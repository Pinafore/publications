Complex question answering often requires finding
a reasoning chain that consists of 
multiple evidence pieces.
%evidence chains.
%
Current approaches incorporate the strengths 
of structured knowledge and unstructured text,
assuming text corpora is semi-structured. 
%structured data is not always available.
%
Building on dense retrieval methods,
we propose a new multi-step retrieval approach (\name{})
that iteratively forms an evidence chain through beam search in 
dense representations.
%
When evaluated on multi-hop question answering, \name{} is competitive
to state-of-the-art systems, \emph{without} using any semi-structured
information.
%
Through query composition in dense space, 
\name{} captures the implicit relationships between evidence 
in the reasoning chain.  The code is available at \url{https://github.com/henryzhao5852/BeamDR}.
