\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclu}

We introduce a simple yet effective multi-step dense retrieval method,
\name{}.
%
By conducting
beam search and globally refreshing negative chains during
training,  \name{} finds reasoning chains in dense
space.
%
\name{} is competitive to more complex \abr{sota}  
systems albeit not using semi-structured information.

While \name{} can uncover relationship embedded within a single
question, future work should investigate how to use these connections
to resolve ambiguity in the question~\cite{elgohary-19,min-20},
resolve entity mentions~\cite{guha-etal-2015-removing}, connect concepts across
modalities~\cite{lei-18}, or to connect related questions to each
other~\cite{elgohary-18}.
