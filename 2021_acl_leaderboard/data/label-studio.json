Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2021-04-23T08:13:53.184728Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-23T08:13:53.184751Z", "project": 1}, {"id": 50, "annotations": [{"id": 51, "completed_by": {"id": 2, "email": "joseph.d.barrow@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "state": {}, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["wrong"]}, "id": "1Qo28YFz2-", "from_name": "correctness_classes", "to_name": "correct_label", "type": "choices"}, {"value": {"choices": ["is_answerable"]}, "id": "Y5Mn9bURyh", "from_name": "reason_classes", "to_name": "question", "type": "choices"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2021-04-30T18:19:19.858126Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T18:19:19.858199Z", "lead_time": 44.68, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "task": 50}, {"id": 110, "completed_by": {"id": 3, "email": "hoyle@umd.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "state": {}, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["wrong"]}, "id": "uT39pBoHAd", "from_name": "correctness_classes", "to_name": "correct_label", "type": "choices"}, {"value": {"choices": ["is_answerable"]}, "id": "vv2s7DDe6P", "from_name": "reason_classes", "to_name": "question", "type": "choices"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2021-05-14T16:16:49.417832Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-14T16:16:49.417891Z", "lead_time": 17.843, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "task": 50}], "predictions": [], "file_upload": "tasks_iiIzBl2.json", "data": {"answers": "N/A: No Answer", "question": "What Egyptian president jailed hundreds of members of the Brotherhood?", "is_impossible": "Q is unanswerable", "title": "Islamism", "qid": "5acfea0677cf76001a686466", "context": "Some elements of the Brotherhood, though perhaps against orders, did engage in violence against the government, and its founder Al-Banna was assassinated in 1949 in retaliation for the assassination of Egypt's premier Mahmud Fami Naqrashi three months earlier.

David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased (Rhoda 1994:148). Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units.

Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"antiforms\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"synforms\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2021-04-23T08:13:53.182860Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-23T08:13:53.182883Z", "project": 1}, {"id": 31, "annotations": [{"id": 32, "completed_by": {"id": 2, "email": "joseph.d.barrow@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "state": {}, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["correct"]}, "id": "lX2Hguj1o4", "from_name": "correctness_classes", "to_name": "correct_label", "type": "choices"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2021-04-30T17:46:21.519592Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T17:46:21.519650Z", "lead_time": 57.86, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "task": 31}, {"id": 91, "completed_by": {"id": 3, "email": "hoyle@umd.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "state": {}, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["flawed"]}, "id": "658BJL6A2Y", "from_name": "correctness_classes", "to_name": "correct_label", "type": "choices"}, {"value": {"choices": ["bad_question", "ambiguous"]}, "id": "1JlQ98wr2S", "from_name": "reason_classes", "to_name": "question", "type": "choices"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2021-05-14T16:00:43.388855Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-14T16:00:43.388912Z", "lead_time": 25.244, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "task": 31}], "predictions": [], "file_upload": "tasks_iiIzBl2.json", "data": {"answers": "second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale | compresses the most recent era | compresses the most recent era", "question": "Why is the second timeline needed?

Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2021-04-23T08:13:53.180193Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-23T08:13:53.180218Z", "project": 1}, {"id": 4, "annotations": [{"id": 5, "completed_by": {"id": 2, "email": "joseph.d.barrow@gmail.com", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "state": {}, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["correct"]}, "id": "BBGqBJPYe7", "from_name": "correctness_classes", "to_name": "correct_label", "type": "choices"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2021-04-30T16:52:28.514616Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T16:52:28.514673Z", "lead_time": 50.428, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "task": 4}, {"id": 64, "completed_by": {"id": 3, "email": "hoyle@umd.edu", "first_name": "", "last_name": ""}, "state": {}, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["correct"]}, "id": "O0z4vd-6D6", "from_name": "correctness_classes", "to_name": "correct_label", "type": "choices"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2021-05-08T16:15:31.836018Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-08T16:15:31.836072Z", "lead_time": 47.29, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "task": 4}], "predictions": [], "file_upload": "tasks_iiIzBl2.json", "data": {"answers": "modern cryptographic systems | modern cryptographic systems | RSA algorithm", "question": "That there currently exists no known integer factorization problem underpins what commonly used system?", "is_impossible": "Q is answerable", "title": "Computational_complexity_theory", "qid": "56e1ec83cd28a01900c67c0c", "context": "The integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP will equal co-NP). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes time O(e(64/9)1/3(n.log 2)1/3(log (n.log 2))2/3) to factor an n-bit integer. However, the best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor's algorithm, does run in polynomial time.
