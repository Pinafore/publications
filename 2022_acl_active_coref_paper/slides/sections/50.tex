\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
\onslide<1->
\item To reduce annotation for transferring coreference resolution models, we use active learning to choose text spans for users to label
\onslide<2->
\item We explore various aspects of active learning for coreference resolution,
    like sources of
model uncertainty and the trade-off between reading and labeling
\onslide<3->
\item Surprisingly, sampling by mention detection entropy is more useful for domains like
PreCo
\onslide<4->
\item In both simulations and the user study,
there are more benefits from sampling spans from the same document rather than different
contexts
