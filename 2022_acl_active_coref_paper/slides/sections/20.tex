\onslide<1-> Find particular spans of text for users to label
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figfile{example_target.pdf}}}
\onslide<2-> The goal is to adapt the model to the target domain by continue
training it on these newly labeled spans
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Method: Active Learning}
We explore active learning for adapting CR models by:
\begin{enumerate}
\onslide<1-> \item Sampling spans according to different sources of model
uncertainty
\onslide<2-> \item Understanding the trade-off between reading and labeling
costs
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
