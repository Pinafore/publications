\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present spectral and interactive topic models for multilingual document collections.  The goal is to bridge the language gap using a multitude of resources: a dictionary, corpora, statistical models, and human input.  A model that relies entirely on one resource is impractical for use in many settings, especially for low-resource situations.  Multilingual anchoring can work with or without label supervision.  Dictionary entries can be scarce or not fully accurate.  People can use \mtanchor without a deep knowledge of topic modeling or machine learning.  The method's versatility and speed make it an alternative to models like neural networks, which need a preponderance of labeled data.  Future work can focus on understanding the effect of human input on multilingual topic models and accurately reflecting their feedback in cross-lingual representations.
