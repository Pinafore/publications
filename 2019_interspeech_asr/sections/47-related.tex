\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}


This work owes its roots to the provision of additional information
through lattices.  Word lattices have been used for improvement before
the prevalence of neural models \cite{ney1999speech,
  casacuberta2004some, dyer2008generalizing}.  Lattice integration has
been used for machine translation ~\cite{su2017lattice}.  Diverse
approaches contribute to higher accuracies.  Attention modifications
~\cite{wang2016inner}, curriculum learning ~\cite{sachan2016easy},
training on past mistakes \cite{yavuz2017recovering}, decomposed
simple models ~\cite{ture2017no}, and tailoring embeddings
~\cite{tan2016improved}. have improved answers for domains such as
insurance, science, and the web.  These branches all have a common
trunk: \textit {clean data for training, and often testing, the
  models}.
