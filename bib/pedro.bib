Both parameters are estimated from the data. Chapters 1-7 present the basic theory with a minimum of mathematics. Chapters 8-10 present in detail the mathematics underlying the models.

  abstract  = {From the Publisher: Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems is a complete andaccessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty. The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertaintyand offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognitionin short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability.}

  abstract  = {Evaluating search system effectiveness is a foundational hallmark of information retrieval research. Doing so requires infrastructure appropriate for the task at hand, which generally follows the Cranfield paradigm: test collections and associated evaluation measures. A primary purpose of Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation campaigns such as Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) and Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) is to build this infrastructure. The first TREC collections targeted the same task as the original Cranfield tests and used measures that were familiar to test collection users of the time. But as evaluation tasks have multiplied and diversified, test collection construction techniques and evaluation measure definitions have also been forced to evolve. This chapter examines how the Cranfield paradigm has been adapted to meet the changing requirements for search systems enabling it to continue to support a vibrant research community.},

We conclude that Wikipedia provides better coverage and longer articles, that Wikipedia typically has more articles on women than Britannica in absolute terms, but Wikipedia articles on women are more likely to be missing than articles on men relative to Britannica. For both reference works, article length did not consistently differ by gender.},

A (simple) Turing test works on the assumption that a computer (or robot) must be marked as intelligent if and only if a person behind a veil and thus not knowing his communication partners' identity communicating with both the computer and a human is no longer able to distinguish appropriately between human and computer. The question raised and expanded here concerns how a computer would have to behave, in a comparable experimental design, in order to succeed in creating the impression it is in fact a human having dignity.},
