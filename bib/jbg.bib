  abstract    = {{This book describes the main objective of EuroWordNet,
          which is the building of a multilingual database with
          lexical semantic networks or wordnets for several European
          languages. Each wordnet in the database represents a
          language-specific structure due to the unique
          lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are
          inter-linked via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where
          equivalent concepts across languages should share the same
          index item. The flexible multilingual design of the
          database makes it possible to compare the lexicalizations
          and semantic structures, revealing answers to fundamental
          linguistic and philosophical questions which could never be
          answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic
          networks across languages, what are the language-specific
          differences of these networks, is there a
          language-universal ontology, how much information can be
          shared across languages? First attempts to answer these
          questions are given in the form of a set of shared or
          common Base Concepts that has been derived from the
          separate wordnets and their classification by a
          language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts play a
          fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the
          database may also serve many practical needs with respect
          to (cross-language) information retrieval, machine
          translation tools, language generation tools and language
          learning tools, which are discussed in the final chapter.
          <br/> The book offers an excellent introduction to the
          EuroWordNet project for scholars in the field and raises
          many issues that set the directions for further research in
          semantics and knowledge engineering.}},

          mid-90s? How does an unknown novelist end up a bestselling
          author? Why is teenage smoking out of control, when
          everyone knows smoking kills? What makes TV shows like
          Sesame Street so good at teaching kids how to read? Why did
          Paul Revere succeed with his famous warning? In this
          brilliant and groundbreaking book, New Yorker writer
          Malcolm Gladwell looks at why major changes in our society
          so often happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Ideas, behavior,
          messages, and products, he argues, often spread like
          outbreaks of infectious disease. Just as a single sick
          person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few
          fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave,
          or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new
          restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when
          they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the
          Tipping Point. <P>In The Tipping Point, Gladwell introduces
          us to the particular personality types who are natural
          pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create
          the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion
          trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail and the
          early days of the American Revolution for clues about
          making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a
          successful high-tech company, and one of the world's
          greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social
          epidemics. The Tipping Point is an intellectual adventure
          story written with an infectious enthusiasm for the power
          and joy of new ideas. Most of all, it is a road map to
          change, with a profoundly hopeful message--that one

  abstract    = {The minimum description length (MDL) principle is a
          powerful method of inductive inference, the basis of
          statistical modeling, pattern recognition, and machine
          learning. It holds that the best explanation, given a
          limited set of observed data, is the one that permits the
          greatest compression of the data. MDL methods are
          particularly well-suited for dealing with model selection,
          prediction, and estimation problems in situations where the
          models under consideration can be arbitrarily complex, and
          overfitting the data is a serious concern. This extensive,
          step-by-step introduction to the MDL Principle provides a
          comprehensive reference (with an emphasis on conceptual
          issues) that is accessible to graduate students and
          researchers in statistics, pattern classification, machine
          learning, and data mining, to philosophers interested in
          the foundations of statistics, and to researchers in other
          applied sciences that involve model selection, including
          biology, econometrics, and experimental psychology. Part I
          provides a basic introduction to MDL and an overview of the
          concepts in statistics and information theory needed to
          understand MDL. Part II treats universal coding, the
          information-theoretic notion on which MDL is built, and
          part III gives a formal treatment of MDL theory as a theory
          of inductive inference based on universal coding. Part IV
          provides a comprehensive overview of the statistical theory
          of exponential families with an emphasis on their
          information-theoretic properties. The text includes a
          number of summaries, paragraphs offering the reader a
          \&quot;fast track\&quot; through the material, and boxes
          highlighting the most important concepts.},

          Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov
          models based on directed graphical models, which can be
          biased towards states with few successor states. We present
          iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional
          random fields and compare the performance of the resulting

  abstract    = {An important part of our information-gathering behavior
          has always been to find out what other people think. With
          the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich
          resources such as online review sites and personal blogs,
          new opportunities and challenges arise as people can and
          do, actively use information technologies to seek out and
          understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of
          activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment
          analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of
          opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus
          occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge
          of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions
          as a first-class object. Opinion Mining and Sentiment
          Analysis covers techniques and approaches that promise to
          directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking
          systems. The focus is on methods that seek to address the
          new challenges raised by available resources, benchmark
          datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.
          Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the first such
          comprehensive survey of this vibrant and important research
          area and will be of interest to anyone with sentiment-aware
          applications, as compared to those that are already present
          in more traditional fact-based analysis. The survey
          includes an enumeration of the various applications, a look
          at general challenges and discusses categorization,
          extraction and summarization. Finally, it moves beyond just
          the technical issues, devoting significant attention to the
          broader implications that the development of
          opinion-oriented information-access services have:
          questions of privacy, vulnerability to manipulation and
          whether or not reviews can have measurable economic impact.
          To facilitate future work, a discussion of available
          resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is
          also provided. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the
          first such comprehensive survey of this vibrant and

  abstract    = {Language, whether spoken or written, is an important
          window into people's emotional and cognitive worlds. Text
          analysis of these narratives, focusing on specific words or
          classes of words, has been used in numerous research
          studies including studies of emotional, cognitive,
          structural and process components of individuals' verbal
          and written language. It was in this research context that
          the LIWC program was developed. The program analyzes text
          files on a word-by-word basis, calculating percentage words
          that match each of several language dimensions. Its output
          is a text file that can be opened in any of a variety of
          applications, including word processors and spreadsheet
          programs. The program has 68 pre-set dimensions (output
          variables) including linguistic dimensions, word categories
          tapping psychological constructs and personal concern
          categories and can accommodate user-defined dimensions as
          well. Easy to install and use, this software offers
          researchers in social, personality, clinical and applied
          psychology a valuable tool for quantifying the rich but
          often slippery data provided in the form of personal
          narratives. The software comes complete on one diskette and
          runs on any Windows-based computer.},

  abstract    = {{This book describes the main objective of EuroWordNet,
          which is the building of a multilingual database with
          lexical semantic networks or wordnets for several European
          languages. Each wordnet in the database represents a
          language-specific structure due to the unique
          lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are
          inter-linked via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where
          equivalent concepts across languages should share the same
          index item. The flexible multilingual design of the
          database makes it possible to compare the lexicalizations
          and semantic structures, revealing answers to fundamental
          linguistic and philosophical questions which could never be
          answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic
          networks across languages, what are the language-specific
          differences of these networks, is there a
          language-universal ontology, how much information can be
          shared across languages? First attempts to answer these
          questions are given in the form of a set of shared or
          common Base Concepts that has been derived from the
          separate wordnets and their classification by a
          language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts play a
          fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the
          database may also serve many practical needs with respect
          to (cross-language) information retrieval, machine
          translation tools, language generation tools and language
          learning tools, which are discussed in the final chapter.
          <br/> The book offers an excellent introduction to the
          EuroWordNet project for scholars in the field and raises
          many issues that set the directions for further research in
          semantics and knowledge engineering.}},

  abstract    = {{We consider learning in a Markov decision process where
          we are not explicitly given a reward function, but where
          instead we can observe an expert demonstrating the task
          that we want to learn to perform. This setting is useful in
          applications (such as the task of driving) where it may be
          difficult to write down an explicit reward function
          specifying exactly how different desiderata should be
          traded off. We think of the expert as trying to maximize a
          reward function that is expressible as a linear combination
          of known features, and give an algorithm for learning the
          task demonstrated by the expert. Our algorithm is based on
          using "inverse reinforcement learning" to try to recover
          the unknown reward function. We show that our algorithm
          terminates in a small number of iterations, and that even
          though we may never recover the expert's reward function,
          the policy output by the algorithm will attain performance
          close to that of the expert, where here performance is
          measured with respect to the expert's unknown reward
          function.}},

  abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8 percent winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

          exposes the mathematics and underlying assumptions of

          Krippendorffs alpha; relates these coefficients to explicit
          models of annotator error; discusses the use of

          be more appropriate for many corpus annotation tasks but
          that their use makes the interpretation of the value of the

@InProceedings{banko-07,
  abstract    = {Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) has focused on
          satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from
          small homogeneous corpora (e.g., extract the location and
          time of seminars from a set of announcements). Shifting to
          a new domain requires the user to name the target relations
          and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new
          training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with
          the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open
          IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes
          a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a
          large set of relational tuples without requiring any human
          input. The paper also introduces TextRunner, a fully
          implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples
          are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient
          extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on
          experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare
          TextRunner with KnowItAll, a state-of-the-art Web IE
          system. TextRunner achieves an error reduction of 33\% on a
          comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount
          of time it takes KnowItAll to perform extraction for a
          handful of pre-specified relations, TextRunner extracts a
          far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude
          more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics
          on TextRunner's 11,000,000 highest probability tuples and
          show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and
          over 6,500,000 more abstract assertions.},

  abstract    = {We describe a new method for visualizing topics, the
          distributions over terms that are automatically extracted
          from large text corpora using latent variable models. Our
          method finds significant \$n\$-grams related to a topic,
          which are then used to help understand and interpret the
          underlying distribution. Compared with the usual
          visualization, which simply lists the most probable topical
          terms, the multi-word expressions provide a better
          intuitive impression for what a topic is "about." Our
          approach is based on a language model of arbitrary length
          expressions, for which we develop a new methodology based
          on nested permutation tests to find significant phrases. We
          show that this method outperforms the more standard use of
          \$\chi^2\$ and likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the
          topic presentations on corpora of scientific abstracts and
          news articles.},

  abstract    = "Background: Public health officials and policy makers in
          the United States expend significant resources at the
          national, state, county, and city levels to measure the
          rate of influenza infection. These individuals rely on
          influenza infection rate information to make important
          decisions during the course of an influenza season driving
          vaccination campaigns, clinical guidelines, and medical
          staffing. Web and social media data sources have emerged as
          attractive alternatives to supplement existing practices.
          While traditional surveillance methods take 1-2 weeks, and
          significant labor, to produce an infection estimate in each
          locale, web and social media data are available in near
          real-time for a broad range of locations. Objective: The
          objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy of flu
          surveillance from combining data from the websites Google
          Flu Trends and HealthTweets at the local level. We
          considered both emergency department influenza-like illness
          cases and laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for a single
          hospital in the City of Baltimore. Methods: This was a
          retrospective observational study comparing estimates of
          influenza activity of Google Flu Trends and Twitter to
          actual counts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed
          influenza, and counts of individuals presenting to the
          emergency department with influenza-like illness cases.
          Data were collected from November 20, 2011 through March
          16, 2014. Each parameter was evaluated on the municipal,
          regional, and national scale. We examined the utility of
          social media data for tracking actual influenza infection
          at the municipal, state, and national levels. Specifically,
          we compared the efficacy of Twitter and Google Flu Trends
          data. Results: We found that municipal-level Twitter data
          was more effective than regional and national data when
          tracking actual influenza infection rates in a Baltimore
          inner-city hospital. When combined, national-level Twitter
          and Google Flu Trends data outperformed each data source
          individually. In addition, influenza-like illness data at
          all levels of geographic granularity were best predicted by
          national Google Flu Trends data. Conclusions: In order to
          overcome sensitivity to transient events, such as the news
          cycle, the best-fitting Google Flu Trends model relies on a
          4-week moving average, suggesting that it may also be
          sacrificing sensitivity to transient fluctuations in
          influenza infection to achieve predictive power.
          Implications for influenza forecasting are discussed in
          this report. ",

  abstract    = {In this article I examine cognates, lexical items from
          different languages which are identified by bilinguals as
          somehow being 'the same thing'. Cognates have at least 4
          essential properties: 1) they are always structural units;
          2) they are words; 3) words paired may be but need not be
          semantically identical; 4) there is always some kind of
          formal resemblance between cognates. I argue that these
          properties can be explained in terms of a particular model
          of lexical activation and word recognition, namely the
          Cohort Model. I also take up the question of defining
          cognates for psycho linguistic purposes and argue against
          using traditional extensional definitions based on
          etymology and genetic relatedness. I argue for defining
          cognates in terms of their structural representations and
          the processes which activate and select them. },

@Article{cassell:2001,
  abstract    = {How do we decide how to represent an intelligent system in
          its interface, and how do we decide how the interface
          represents information about the world and about its own
          workings to a user? This article addresses these questions
          by examining the interaction between representation and
          intelligence in user interfaces. The rubric representation
          covers at least three topics in this context: (1) how a
          computational system is represented in its user interface,
          (2) how the interface conveys its representations of
          information and the world to human users, and (3) how the
          system's internal representation affects the human user's
          interaction with the system. I argue that each of these
          kinds of representation (of the system, information and the
          world, the interaction) is key to how users make the kind
          of attributions of intelligence that facilitate their
          interactions with intelligent systems. In this vein, it
          makes sense to represent a systmem as a human in those
          cases where social collaborative behavior is key and for
          the system to represent its knowledge to humans in multiple
          ways on multiple modalities. I demonstrate these claims by
          discussing issues of representation and intelligence in an
          embodied conversational agent -- an interface in which the
          system is represented as a person, information is conveyed
          to human users by multiple modalities such as voice and
          hand gestures, and the internal representation is modality
          independent and both propositional and nonpropositional.},

          intuitive derivation of this method is given along with
          guidance on implementation. Also discussed are two
          applications of the algorithm, one for implementing
          acceptance-rejection sampling when a blanketing function is
          not available and the other for implementing the algorithm
          with block-at-a-time scans. In the latter situation, many
          different algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are
          shown to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings
          algorithm. The methods are illustrated with examples.}},

  abstract    = {Current research on the influence of electronic
          communication technologies such as electronic mail, World
          Wide Web, electronic journals, bibliographic databases and
          on-line card catalogs suggest that they broaden academic
          research communities and change the ways researchers work.
          However, it is less well-understood how these changes take
          place. One explanation is that the mechanism for change is
          generational: doctoral students transform research
          disciplines as they apply new electronic communication
          skills they ?grew up with.? This article examines this
          explanation and related claims through evidence from a
          study of 28 graduate students and their advisors in four
          disciplines at eight U.S. research universities. Although
          all the doctoral students used electronic communication
          technologies in various ways, their work practices
          reinforced existing patterns of work and resource use in
          their disciplines. Students used electronic communication
          to (1) mimic the electronic communication patterns of their
          advisor, (2) differentiate or specialize their research
          with respect to their advisor or research specialty, (3)
          enhance the social connections and material resources their
          advisor or institution provided to them, and/or (4) ease or
          improve ?hands-on? research techniques (textual analysis,
          wet lab work, programming, statistical analysis) that their
          advisor or research group delegated to them.},

  abstract    = {The distinction between syntax (sentence form) and
          semantics (sentence meaning) is fundamental to our thinking
          about language. Whether and where this distinction is
          represented at the neural level is still a matter of
          considerable debate. In the present fMRI study, we examined
          the neural correlates of syntactic and semantic functions
          using an innovative activation paradigm specifically
          designed to unequivocally disentangle syntactic from
          lexicosemantic aspects of sentence processing. Our findings
          strongly indicate that a part of Broca's area (BA 44, pars
          opercularis) is critically implicated in processing
          syntactic information, whereas the lower portion of the
          left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47, pars orbitalis) is
          selectively involved in processing the semantic aspects of
          a sentence.},

  abstract    = {The most basic assumption used in statistical learning
          theory is that training data and test data are drawn from
          the same underlying distribution. Unfortunately, in many
          applications, the "in-domain" test data is drawn from a
          distribution that is related, but not identical, to the
          "out-of-domain" distribution of the training data. We
          consider the common case in which labeled out-of-domain
          data is plentiful, but labeled in-domain data is scarce. We
          introduce a statistical formulation of this problem in
          terms of a simple mixture model and present an
          instantiation of this framework to maximum entropy
          classifiers and their linear chain counterparts. We present
          efficient inference algorithms for this special case based
          on the technique of conditional expectation maximization.
          Our experimental results show that our approach leads to
          improved performance on three real world tasks on four
          different data sets from the natural language processing
          domain.},

          data observed in earlier iterations to perform more
          informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the
          adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the
          form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our
          paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic
          optimization and online learning which employ proximal
          functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm.
          We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively
          modifying the proximal function, which significantly
          simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret
          guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal
          function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several
          efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization
          problems with common and important regularization functions
          and domain constraints. We experimentally study our
          theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient
          methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art, yet
          non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.}

  abstract    = {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al.
          for inferring population structure from multilocus genotype
          data. Most importantly, we develop methods that allow for
          linkage between loci. The new model accounts for the
          correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed
          populations ("admixture linkage disequilibium"). This
          modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection
          of admixture events farther back into the past, (2)
          inference of the population of origin of chromosomal
          regions and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical
          uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of
          potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we
          describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies
          within each population, which allows identification of
          subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable
          using the existing method. We present results applying the
          new methods to study admixture in African-Americans,
          recombination in Helicobacter pylori and drift in
          populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods are
          implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is

          extent of the challenge includes fielding a real-time
          automatic contestant on the show, not merely a laboratory
          exercise. The Jeopardy! Challenge helped us address
          requirements that led to the design of the DeepQA
          architecture and the implementation of Watson. After 3
          years of intense research and development by a core team of
          about 20 researches, Watson is performing at human
          expert-levels in terms of precision, confidence and speed
          at the Jeopardy! Quiz show. Our results strongly suggest
          that DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Named entity recognition (NER) is an important
          first step for text mining the biomedical literature.
          Evaluating the performance of biomedical NER systems is
          impossible without a standardized test corpus. The
          annotation of such a corpus for gene/protein name NER is a
          difficult process due to the complexity of gene/protein
          names. We describe the construction and annotation of
          GENETAG, a corpus of 20K MEDLINE sentences for gene/protein
          NER. 15K GENETAG sentences were used for the BioCreAtIvE
          Task 1A Competition. RESULTS: To ensure heterogeneity of
          the corpus, MEDLINE sentences were first scored for term
          similarity to documents with known gene names and 10K high-
          and 10K low-scoring sentences were chosen at random. The
          original 20K sentences were run through a gene/protein name
          tagger and the results were modified manually to reflect a
          wide definition of gene/protein names subject to a
          specificity constraint, a rule that required the tagged
          entities to refer to specific entities. Each sentence in
          GENETAG was annotated with acceptable alternatives to the
          gene/protein names it contained, allowing for partial
          matching with semantic constraints. Semantic constraints
          are rules requiring the tagged entity to contain its true
          meaning in the sentence context. Application of these
          constraints results in a more meaningful measure of the
          performance of an NER system than unrestricted partial
          matching. CONCLUSION: The annotation of GENETAG required
          intricate manual judgments by annotators which hindered
          tagging consistency. The data were pre-segmented into
          words, to provide indices supporting comparison of system
          responses to the "gold standard". However, character-based
          indices would have been more robust than word-based
          indices. GENETAG Train, Test and Round1 data and ancillary
          programs are freely available at
          ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/tanabe/GENETAG.tar.gz. A
          newer version of GENETAG-05, will be released later this
          year.},

          an information source will infer that the source is of
          higher quality when its reports conform to the consumer's
          prior expectations. We use this fact to build a model of
          media bias in which firms slant their reports toward the
          prior beliefs of their customers in order to build a
          reputation for quality. Bias emerges in our model even
          though it can make all market participants worse off. The
          model predicts that bias will be less severe when consumers
          receive independent evidence on the true state of the
          world, and that competition between independently owned
          news outlets can reduce bias. We present a variety of
          empirical evidence consistent with these predictions.}

          designed for negotiation against users of different
          cultural norms (individualists, collectivists, and
          altruists). In order to learn these policies we build
          simulated users {(SUs)}, i.e. models that simulate the
          behavior of real users, and use reinforcement learning
          {(RL).} The {SUs} are trained on a spoken dialogue corpus
          in a negotiation domain, and then tweaked towards a
          particular cultural norm using hand-crafted rules. We
          evaluate the learned policies in a simulation setting. Our
          results are consistent with our {SUs}, in other words, the
          policies learn what they are designed to learn, which shows
          that {RL} is a promising technique for learning policies in

          information conveyed to a hearer by a speaker emitting a
          sentence generated by a probabilistic grammar known to both
          parties. The method applies the work of Grenander (1967) to
          the intermediate states of a top-down parser. This allows
          the uncertainty about structural ambiguity to be calculated
          at each point in a sentence. Subtracting these values at
          successive points gives the information conveyed by a word
          in a sentence. Word-by-word information conveyed is
          calculated for several small probabilistic grammars, and it
          is suggested that the number of bits conveyed per word is a
          determinant of reading times and other measures of
          cognitive load.}},

  abstract    = {The research access/impact problem arises because journal
          articles are not accessible to all of their would-be users;
          hence, they are losing potential research impact. The
          solution is to make all articles open access (OA, i.e.,
          accessible online, free for all). OA articles have
          significantly higher citation impact than non-OA articles.
          There are two roads to OA: the ?golden? road (publish your
          article in an OA journal) and the ?green? road (publish
          your article in a non-OA journal but also self-archive it
          in an OA archive). About 10\% of journals are gold, but
          over 90\% are already green (i.e., they have given their
          authors the green light to self-archive); yet only about
          10?20\% of articles have been self-archived. To reach 100\%

          provide examples of the process on several large decision
          problems, showing that, for these examples, the process

  comment    = {When costs of computation are not taken into account,
          optimal policies can be determined using dynamic
          programming [Howard and Matheson, 1984; Shachter, 1986].
          When the costs of computation are not negligible, the cost
          of computing the optimal policy using dynamic programming
          may be prohibitive. We have developed an algorithm which
          can be used to compute policies for large multi-stage
          decision problems under uncertainty represented as
          influence diagrams. Our approach is incremental, and uses
          abstraction. An influence diagram(ID) is a DAG representing
          a sequential decision problem under uncertainty [Howard and
          Matheson, 1984]. An ID models the subjective beliefs,
          preferences, and available actions from the perspective of
          a single decision maker. A decision tree represents a
          decision function. The single stage information refinement
          algorithm constructs a decision tree for a influence
          diagram with a single decision node. A policy is
          represented by a collection of decision trees, one for each
          decision node in the influence diagram. A deterministic
          decision tree is an inappropriate representation for a
          decision function in a multi-stage policywhich is being
          refined. For multi--stage decision problems, the refinement
          may have ramifications for the global policy. Neither of
          these complications occur for single-stage problems.},

          the importance of negotiating effectively across cultures,
          paradoxically, little research has addressed what predicts
          intercultural negotiation effectiveness. In this research,
          we examined the impact of cultural intelligence (CQ) on
          intercultural negotiation processes and outcomes,
          controlling for other types of intelligence (cognitive
          ability and emotional intelligence), personality (openness
          and extraversion), and international experience.
          Transcripts of 124 American and East Asian negotiators were
          coded for sequences of integrative information behaviors
          and cooperative relationship management behaviors. CQ
          measured a week prior to negotiations predicted the extent
          to which negotiators sequenced integrative information
          behaviors, which in turn predicted joint profit, over and
          beyond other individual differences. Additional analyses
          revealed that the level of integrative sequencing was more
          a function of the lower-scoring than the higher-scoring
          negotiator within the dyad. Other individual difference
          characteristics were not related to effective intercultural
          negotiation processes. Theoretical and practical
          implications are discussed.},

          scalable process for people and machines working together
          to identify sections of text that reflect specific human
          values. A total of 2,005 sentences from 28 prepared
          testimonies presented before hearings on Net neutrality
          were manually annotated for one or more of ten human values
          using an annotation frame based on experience annotating
          similar content using the Schwartz Values Inventory.
          Moderately good agreement suggests that meaningful
          distinctions can often be drawn by human annotators.
          Several k-Nearest-Neighbor classifiers were compared in
          this preliminary study, yielding results that appear

  abstract    = {Topic models have been studied extensively in the context
          of monolingual corpora. Though there are some attempts to
          mine topical structure from cross-lingual corpora, they
          require clues about document alignments. In this paper we
          present a generative model called JointLDA which uses a
          bilingual dictionary to mine multilingual topics from an
          unaligned corpus. Experiments conducted on different data
          sets confirm our conjecture that jointly modeling the
          cross-lingual corpora offers several advantages compared to
          individual monolingual models. Since the JointLDA model
          merges related topics in different languages into a single
          multilingual topic: a) it can fit the data with relatively
          fewer topics. b) it has the ability to predict related
          words from a language different than that of the given
          document. In fact it has better predictive power compared
          to the bag-of-word based translation model leaving the
          possibility for JointLDA to be preferred over bag-of-word
          model for cross-lingual IR applications. We also found that
          the monolingual models learnt while optimizing the
          cross-lingual copora are more effective than the
          corresponding LDA models. },

  abstract    = {{The problems of access--retrieving linguistic structure
          from some mental grammar --and disambiguation--choosing
          among these structures to correctly parse ambiguous
          linguistic input--are fundamental to language
          understanding. The literature abounds with psychological
          results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic
          rule access, parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation,
          and the processing of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately,
          it has been difficult to combine models which account for
          these results to build a general, uniform model of access
          and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic
          levels. For example, psycholinguistic theories of lexical
          access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic
          rule access have almost no commonality in methodology or
          coverage of psycholinguistic data. This article presents a
          single probabilistic algorithm which models both the access
          and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge. The algorithm
          is based on a parallel parser which ranks constructions for
          access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their
          conditional probability. Low-ranked constructions and
          interpretations are pruned through beam-search; this
          pruning accounts, among other things, for the garden-path
          effect. I show that this motivated probabilistic treatment
          accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results,
          arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic
          knowledge and for the use of probabilistically-enriched
          grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of
          and processing of language.}},

          boilerplate text typically is not related to the main

          be detected properly. In this paper, we analyze a small set
          of shallow text features for classifying the individual
          text elements in a Web page. We compare the approach to
          complex, state-of-the-art techniques and show that
          competitive accuracy can be achieved, at almost no cost.
          Moreover, we derive a simple and plausible stochastic model
          for describing the boilerplate creation process. With the
          help of our model, we also quantify the impact of
          boilerplate removal to retrieval performance and show
          significant improvements over the baseline. Finally, we

  abstract    = {We exploit the redundancy and volume of information on the
          web to build a computerized player for the ABC TV game show
          Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?. The player consists of a
          questionanswering module and a decision-making module. The
          question-answering module utilizes question transformation
          techniques, natural language parsing, multiple information
          retrieval algorithms, and multiple search engines; results
          are combined in the spirit of ensemble learning using an
          adaptive weighting scheme. Empirically, the system
          correctly answers about 75% of questions from the
          Millionaire CD-ROM, 3rd editiongeneral-interest trivia
          questions often about popular culture and common knowledge.
          The decision-making module chooses from allowable actions
          in the game in order to maximize expected risk-adjusted
          winnings, where the estimated probability of answering
          correctly is a function of past performance and confidence
          in correctly answering the current question. When given a
          six question head start (i.e., when starting from the
          \$2,000 level), we find that the system performs about as
          well on average as humans starting at the beginning. Our
          system demonstrates the potential of simple but well-chosen
          techniques for mining answers from unstructured information

          intellectually created links such as author-chosen keywords
          and titles, authority indexing terms, or bibliographic
          citations. Similarity of the semantic content of whole
          documents, rather than just titles, abstracts, or overlap
          of keywords, offers an attractive alternative. Latent
          semantic analysis provides an effective dimension reduction
          method for the purpose that reflects synonymy and the sense
          of arbitrary word combinations. However, latent semantic
          analysis correlations with human text-to-text similarity
          judgments are often empirically highest at ≈300
          dimensions. Thus, two- or three-dimensional visualizations
          are severely limited in what they can show, and the first
          and/or second automatically discovered principal component,
          or any three such for that matter, rarely capture all of
          the relations that might be of interest. It is our
          conjecture that linguistic meaning is intrinsically and
          irreducibly very high dimensional. Thus, some method to
          explore a high dimensional similarity space is needed. But
          the 2.7 × 107 projections and infinite rotations of, for
          example, a 300-dimensional pattern are impossible to
          examine. We suggest, however, that the use of a high
          dimensional dynamic viewer with an effective projection
          pursuit routine and user control, coupled with the
          exquisite abilities of the human visual system to extract
          information about objects and from moving patterns, can
          often succeed in discovering multiple revealing views that
          are missed by current computational algorithms. We show
          some examples of the use of latent semantic analysis to
          support such visualizations and offer views on future
          needs.}},

  abstract    = {Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has
          been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has
          developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time
          scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of
          particular named entities. However, these approaches are
          less well suited to the identification of content that
          spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order
          of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and
          events. We develop a framework for tracking short,
          distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through
          on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering
          textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class
          of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a
          daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how
          such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent
          representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the
          news media that have long been the subject of qualitative
          interpretation but have never been captured accurately
          enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked
          1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period
          of three months with the total of 90 million articles and
          we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in
          the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND:We present a model for tagging gene and protein
          mentions from text using the probabilistic sequence tagging
          framework of conditional random fields (CRFs). Conditional
          random fields model the probability P(t|o) of a tag
          sequence given an observation sequence directly and have
          previously been employed successfully for other tagging
          tasks. The mechanics of CRFs and their relationship to
          maximum entropy are discussed in detail.RESULTS:We employ a
          diverse feature set containing standard orthographic
          features combined with expert features in the form of gene
          and biological term lexicons to achieve a precision of 86.4
          and recall of 78.7\%. An analysis of the contribution of
          the various features of the model is provided.},

  abstract    = {Definitions of common nouns typically give a superordinate
          term plus distinguishing features; that information
          provides the basis for organizing noun files in WordNet.
          The superordinate relation (hyponymy) generates a
          hierarchical semantic organization that is duplicated in
          the noun files by the use of labeled pointers between sets
          of synonyms (synsets). The hierarchy is limited in depth,
          seldom exceeding more than a dozen levels. Distinguishing
          features are entered in such a way as to create a lexical
          inheritance system, a system in which each word inherits
          the distinguishing features of all its superordinates.
          Three types of distinguishing features are discussed:
          attributes (modification), parts (meronymy) and functions
          (predication), but only meronymy is presently implemented
          in the noun files. Antonymy is also found between nouns,
          but it is not a fundamental organizing principle for nouns.
          Coverage is partitioned into twenty-five topical files,
          each of which deals with a different primitive semantic
          component. Characteristics of each topic are discussed. },

  abstract    = {The relationship between semantic and contextual
          similarity is investigated for pairs of nouns that vary
          from high to low semantic similarity. Semantic similarity
          is estimated by subjective ratings; contextual similarity
          is estimated by the method of sorting sentential contexts.
          The results show an inverse linear relationship between
          similarity of meaning and the discriminability of contexts.
          This relation, is obtained for two separate corpora of
          sentence contexts. It is concluded that, on average, for
          words in the same language drawn from the same syntactic
          and semantic categories, the more often two words can be
          substituted into the same contexts the more similar in
          meaning they are judged to be.},

  abstract    = {In this paper, we will review the state of the art in
          dependency-based parsing, starting with the theoretical
          foundations of dependency grammar and moving on to consider
          both grammar-driven and data-driven methods for dependency
          parsing. We will limit our attention to systems for
          dependency parsing in a narrow sense, i.e. systems where
          the analysis assigned to an input sentence takes the form
          of a dependency structure. This means that we will not
          discuss systems that exploit dependency relations for the
          construction of another type of representation, such as the
          head-driven parsing models of Collins (1997, 1999).
          Moreover, we will restrict ourselves to systems for full
          parsing, which means that we will not deal with systems
          that produce a partial or underspecified representation of
          dependency structure, such as Constraint Grammar parsers
          (Karlsson, 1990; Karlsson et al., 1995).},

  abstract    = {{10.1518/001872006776412180 Objective: The present study
          examined the relationship between two distinct subfactors
          of spatial ability and performance in an information search
          task modeled on browsing the Web. Background: Previous
          studies have found relationships between various measures
          of spatial ability and performance in a wide variety of
          computerbased tasks. Method: In the search task 101
          participants (18-29 years of age) searched for the answer
          to a question by navigating the system. They completed the
          experimental task as well as a battery of cognitive ability
          measures that included two different measures of spatial
          ability. Results: The results indicate that spatial
          orientation ability was related to performance with tasks
          that were high in their navigational requirement
          (engendered by the use of a novel aid), whereas spatial
          visualization was unrelated to performance in any task
          condition. Conclusion: A closer inspection of the cognitive
          requirements of a task may reveal what interventions could
          be most useful when designing computer systems or
          developing training programs. Application: Given the unique
          differences between the different spatial abilities, the
          current results suggest the design of navigational aids
          that place less demand on spatial orientation ability. Date

  abstract    = {The two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution, denoted
          $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \theta)$ is a probability distribution
          on the set of decreasing positive sequences with sum 1. The
          usual Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with a single
          parameter $\theta$, introduced by Kingman, is
          $\mathsf{PD}(0, \theta)$. Known properties of
          $\mathsf{PD}(0, \theta)$, including the Markov chain
          description due to Vershik, Shmidt and Ignatov, are
          generalized to the two-parameter case. The size-biased
          random permutation of $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \theta)$ is a
          simple residual allocation model proposed by Engen in the
          context of species diversity and rediscovered by Perman and
          the authors in the study of excursions of Brownian motion
          and Bessel processes. For $0 < \alpha < 1,
          \mathsf{PD}(\alpha, 0)$ is the asymptotic distribution of
          ranked lengths of excursions of a Markov chain away from a
          state whose recurrence time distribution is in the domain
          of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha$. Formulae
          in this case trace back to work of Darling, Lamperti and
          Wendel in the 1950s and 1960s. The distribution of ranked
          lengths of excursions of a one-dimensional Brownian motion
          is $\mathsf{PD}(1/2, 0)$ and the corresponding distribution
          for a Brownian bredge is $\mathsf{PD}(1/2, 1/2)$. The
          $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, 0)$ and $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \alpha)$
          distributions admit a similar interpretation in terms of
          the ranked lengths of excursions of a semistable Markov
          process whose zero set is the range of a stable subordinator of index $\alpha$.},

  abstract    = {This tutorial provides an overview of the basic theory of
          hidden Markov models (HMMs) as originated by L.E. Baum and
          T. Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of
          implementation of the theory along with a description of
          selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in
          speech recognition. Results from a number of original
          sources are combined to provide a single source of
          acquiring the background required to pursue further this
          area of research. The author first reviews the theory of
          discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden
          states, where the observation is a probabilistic function
          of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is
          illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing
          and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental
          problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques
          for solving these problems are given. The various types of
          HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as
          left-right models, are described},

          linguistics is of basic importance: its data and methods
          show better than those of any other discipline dealing with
          socialized behavior the possibility of a truly scientific
          study of society. Linguists should, on the other hand,
          become aware of what their science may mean for the

          aspects in the content of human values. Ten types of values
          are distinguished by their motivational goals. The theory
          also postulates a structure of relations among the value
          types, based on the conflicts and compatibilities
          experienced when pursuing them. This structure permits one
          to relate systems of value priorities, as an integrated
          whole, to other variables. A new values instrument, based
          on the theory and suitable for cross-cultural research, is
          described. Evidence relevant for assessing the theory, from
          97 samples in 44 countries, is summarized. Relations of
          this approach to Rokeach's work on values and to other
          theories and research on value dimensions are discussed.
          Application of the approach to social issues is exemplified
          in the domains of politics and intergroup relations.}},

  abstract    = {{The key idea behind active learning is that a machine
          learning algorithm can achieve greater accuracy with fewer
          labeled training instances if it is allowed to choose the
          training data from which is learns. An active learner may
          ask queries in the form of unlabeled instances to be
          labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active
          learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning
          problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant but labels
          are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This
          report provides a general introduction to active learning
          and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion
          of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an
          overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the
          literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and
          theoretical evidence for active learning, a summary of
          several problem setting variants, and a discussion of
          related topics in machine learning research are also

  abstract    = {{Using a sentiment score provided by Thomson Reuters to
          measure the tone of news articles, this paper examines
          monthly portfolio returns constructed from information
          about past news articles. The sentiment score is obtained
          from the kind of words and phrases that are used in the
          news article. Positive tone in news articles in the past
          months predicts positive returns. Similarly, negative tone
          in the past months predicts negative returns. Past
          sentiment predicts future returns even for large stocks.
          The predictive ability of past sentiment dominates the
          predictive ability of past returns. After controlling for
          past sentiment, the predictive ability of past returns (in
          predicting future return) disappears. The findings are
          robust to multiple specifications. The predictive ability
          of past sentiment can be used profitably. When applied to
          the largest decile of stocks, a strategy that takes a long
          position in stocks with past positive sentiment score and a
          short position in stocks with past negative sentiment score
          generates a statistically significant alpha of 34 basis
          points per month. The resulting portfolio is also
          positively correlated with a long-short momentum portfolio.
          Within the same time period, a trading strategy using the
          sentiment scores from the subset of news articles citing
          analysts is not profitable. The news items that cite
          analysts have economically significant contemporaneous
          returns. The findings suggest that (i) the market
          underreacts to information contained in news articles, (ii)
          momentum might be related to underreaction to the sentiment
          information, and (iii) market participants pay attention to
          sentiment score information in analyst news. The findings
          are consistent with a model where one trader has private
          information and others are trading based on past returns
          and volume information.}},

          densities are designed to be combined with observed amino

          developed, “the THYME Guidelines to ISO-TimeML
          (THYME-TimeML)”. To clarify what relations merit
          annotation, we distinguish between linguistically-derived
          and inferentially-derived temporal orderings in the text.
          We also apply a top performing TempEval 2013 system against
          this new resource to measure the difficulty of adapting
          systems to the clinical domain. The corpus is available to
          the community and has been proposed for use in a SemEval
          2015 task. },

  abstract    = {{We develop a new version of prospect theory that employs
          cumulative rather than separable decision weights and
          extends the theory in several respects. This version,
          called cumulative prospect theory, applies to uncertain as
          well as to risky prospects with any number of outcomes, and
          it allows different weighting functions for gains and for
          losses. Two principles, diminishing sensitivity and loss
          aversion, are invoked to explain the characteristic
          curvature of the value function and the weighting
          functions. A review of the experimental evidence and the
          results of a new experiment confirm a distinctive fourfold
          pattern of risk attitudes: risk aversion for gains and risk
          seeking for losses of high probability; risk seeking for
          gains and risk aversion for losses of low probability.}},

  abstract    = {In this paper, we develop the continuous time dynamic
          topic model (cDTM). The cDTM is a dynamic topic model that
          uses Brownian motion to model the latent topics through a
          sequential collection of documents, where a ``topic'' is a
          pattern of word use that we expect to evolve over the
          course of the col- lection. We derive an efficient
          variational approximate inference algorithm that takes
          advantage of the sparsity of observations in text, a
          property that lets us easily han- dle many time points. In
          contrast to the cDTM, the original discrete-time dynamic
          topic model (dDTM) requires that time be discretized.
          Moreover, the complexity of vari- ational inference for the
          dDTM grows quickly as time granularity increases, a
          drawback which limits fne-grained discretization. We
          demonstrate the cDTM on two news corpora, reporting both
          predictive perplexity and the novel task of time stamp
          prediction.},

@InProceedings{wang-10,
  abstract    = {{This paper introduces the notion of temporally
          constrained ranked retrieval, which, given a query and a
          time constraint, produces the best possible ranked list
          within the specified time limit. Naturally, more time
          should translate into bet- ter results, but the ranking
          algorithm should always pro- duce some results. This
          property is desirable from a number of perspectives: to
          cope with diverse users and information needs, as well as
          to better manage system load and variance in query
          execution times. We propose two temporally con- strained
          ranking algorithms based on a class of probabilistic
          prediction models that can naturally incorporate efficiency
          constraints: one that makes independent feature selection
          de- cisions, and the other that makes joint feature
          selection de- cisions. Experiments on three different test
          collections show that both ranking algorithms are able to
          satisfy imposed time constraints, although the joint model
          outperforms the independent model in being able to deliver
          more effective results, especially under tight time
          constraints, due to its ability to capture feature
          dependencies.}},

  abstract    = {This paper describes an automatic text analysis of values
          contained in the Enron email dataset that seeks to explore
          the potential to apply value patterns to cluster a social
          network. Two hypotheses are posed: individuals communicate
          more frequently with other individuals who share similar
          value patterns than with individuals with different value
          patterns; and people who communicate more frequently with
          each other share similar value patterns. The first
          hypothesis is supported: indeed, individuals were found to
          communicate more frequently with individuals who share
          similar value patterns, and further, the extent to which
          this is true appears to depend at least in part on the
          value patterns themselves. However, the second hypothesis
          is not supported - people who communicate more frequently
          with each other do not necessarily all fit into a
          particular value type. Thus, values have utility as a novel
          tool for social network analysis.},

@TechReport{zhu-06,
  abstract    = {Latent Dirichlet Allocation models a document by a mixture
          of topics, where each topic itself is typically modeled by
          a unigram word distribution. Documents however often have
          known structures and the same topic can exhibit different
          word distributions under different parts of the structure.
          We extend latent Dirichlet allocation model by replacing
          the unigram word distributions with a factored
          representation conditioned on both the topic and the
          structure. In the resultant model each topic is equivalent
          to a set of unigrams, reflecting the structure a word is
          in. The proposed model is more flexible in modeling the
          corpus. The factored representation prevents combinatorial
          explosion and leads to efficient parameterization. We
          derive the variational optimization algorithm for the new
          model. The model shows improved perplexity on text and
          image data, but no significant accuracy improvement when
          used for classification.},

          iterative procedure to solve multiple latent SVM
          subproblems with additional mean-field assumptions on the
          desired posterior distributions. This paper presents Gibbs
          max-margin supervised topic models by minimizing an
          expected margin loss, an upper bound of the existing margin
          loss derived from an expected prediction rule. By
          introducing augmented variables, we develop simple and fast
          Gibbs sampling algorithms with no restricting assumptions
          and no need to solve SVM subproblems for both
          classification and regression. Empirical results
          demonstrate significant improvements on time efficiency.
          The classification performance is also significantly
          improved over competitors.},
