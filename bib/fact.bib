  abstract = {We introduce a novel method of generating synthetic question answering corpora by combining models of question generation and answer extraction, and by filtering the results to ensure roundtrip consistency. By pretraining on the resulting corpora we obtain significant improvements on SQuAD2 and NQ, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the latter. Our synthetic data generation models, for both question generation and answer extraction, can be fully reproduced by finetuning a publicly available BERT model on the extractive subsets of SQuAD2 and NQ. We also describe a more powerful variant that does full sequence-to-sequence pretraining for question generation, obtaining exact match and F1 at less than 0.1\% and 0.4\% from human performance on SQuAD2.},

An academic vocabulary dictionary which encompasses 210 academic words was designed for the study and thirteen students coming from two ESL classes used the Anki dictionary for ten minutes every day during the three week intervention process. Pretest and posttest scores of students were compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the learning process. Learners` perceptions about the training were investigated by means of surveys, interviews and observations. The results present the benefits that might be gained from the integration of flashcard programs into a language classroom, as well as the perceptions of learners about the process.},

We utilize a corpus of 240,000 admissions essays submitted by 60,000 applicants to the University of California in November 2016 to measure the relationship between the content of application essays, reported household income, and standardized test scores (SAT) at scale. We quantify essay content using correlated topic modeling (CTM) and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software package. Results show that essays have a stronger correlation to reported household income than SAT scores. Essay content also explains much of the variance in SAT scores, suggesting that essays encode some of the same information as the SAT, though this relationship attenuates as household income increases. Efforts to realize more equitable college admissions protocols can be informed by attending to how social class is encoded in non-numerical components of applications.},

We report an experiment in which the question of whether retrieval is necessary to induce this form of impairment was examined. All the subjects studied six members from each of eight taxonomic categories (e.g.,fruit orange). In the competitive practice condition, the subjects practiced recalling three of the six members, using category-stem cues (e.g.,fruit or\_\_\_\_). In the noncompetitive practice condition, the subjects were reexposed to these same members for the same number of repetitions but were asked to recall the category name by using the exemplar and a stem as cues (e.g.,fr\_\_\_\_orange). Despite significant and comparable facilitation of practiced items in both conditions, only the competitive practice subjects were impaired in their ability to recall the nonpracticed members on a delayed cued-recall test. These findings argue that retrieval-induced forgetting is not caused by increased competition arising from the strengthening of practiced items, but by inhibitory processes specific to the situation of recall.},

Second, we analyzed the data using hierarchical models, avoiding distortions due to averaging over participants. Third, we implemented the models in a Bayesian framework, enabling our analysis to account for the ability of candidate forgetting functions to imitate each other. An exponential function provided the best fit to individual participant data collected under both explicit and implicit retrieval instructions, but Bayesian model selection favored a power function. All analysis supported above chance asymptotic retention, suggesting that, despite quite brief study, storage of some memories was effectively permanent.},

We report two investigations in which long intervals between study sessions yield substantial benefits to long-term retention, at a cost of only moderately longer individual study sessions. When individuals monitor and control encoding over an extended period, targets yielding the largest number of retrieval failures contribute substantially to the spacing advantage.

This study addresses this gap in the research by analyzing the relationship between extended study of a Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) word list using spaced repetition software (SRS) and TOEIC score gains. Two classes of Japanese students totaling 60 participants were encouraged to study a TOEIC word list using SRS for 10 months. TOEIC score gains from a pre-test to a post-test were then correlated with the number of flashcard repetitions to investigate the relationship between SRS study and test score gains. Statistically significant relationships (p {$<$} 0.05) were found between total SRS repetitions and TOEIC listening and overall score gains. Total word list reviews accounted for 11.4\% of the variance in overall TOEIC gains, 6.2\% of the variance in reading gain and 7.2\% of the variance in listening gains. The authors argue that study of test-specific word lists with SRS may be a useful addition to motivated students' test preparation strategies for standardized foreign language proficiency tests.},

Previous work suggests that this mixed evidence can be reconciled by taking into account within- and betweencategory similarity relations. In this article, we present a new moderating factor. Across two experiments, one group of participants studied categories actively (by studying the objects without correct category assignment and actively figuring out what the category was), either interleaved or blocked. Another group studied the same categories passively (objects and correct category assignment were simultaneously provided). Results from a subsequent generalization task show that whether interleaved or blocked study results in better learning depends on whether study is active or passive. One account of these results is that different presentation sequences and tasks promote different patterns of attention to stimulus components. Passive learning and blocking promote attending to commonalities within categories, while active learning and interleaving promote attending to differences between categories.},

However, the questions of how the category structure influences this advantage and how simultaneous presentation interacts with the advantage are open issues. In this article, we present three experiments. The first experiment indicates that the advantage of interleaved over blocked study is modulated by the structure of the categories being studied. More specifically, interleaved study results in better generalization for categories with high within- and between-category similarity, whereas blocked presentation results in better generalization for categories with low within- and between-category similarity. In Experiment 2, we present evidence that when presented simultaneously, between-category comparisons (interleaved presentation) result in a performance advantage for high-similarity categories, but no differences were found for low-similarity categories. In Experiment 3, we directly compared simultaneous and successive presentation of low-similarity categories. We again found an overall benefit for blocked study with these categories. Overall, these results are consistent with the proposal that interleaving emphasizes differences between categories, whereas blocking emphasizes the discovery of commonalities among objects within the same category.},

Whether learners actually fail to appreciate the benefits of spacing is, however, open to question. Early studies (e.g., Zechmeister \& Shaughnessy, 1980) found that participants' judgments of learning were higher after massed than after spaced repetitions, but more recent studies have found that participants, when allowed to choose between restudying right away and restudying later, tend to choose later, apparently reflecting an appreciation for the benefits of spacing. In these recent studies, however, choosing to restudy later also meant restudying closer to the final test, leaving open the question of what was driving participants' choices. In addition, the choice confronting participants has typically been between getting a spaced and truly massed repetition, whereas in real-world learning contexts the choice is often between a short, but not immediate, spacing interval and a longer one. In our research, we controlled final retention interval and asked participants to choose between restudying word pairs after either a relatively short (but not truly massed) interval or a longer interval. We found that participants had a clear preference for restudying higher priority (more difficult or more valuable) items sooner rather than later, even when doing so was not the most effective option. Thus, previous findings showing a preference for spaced repetition do not extend to a context in which the shorter spacing interval is substantially longer than true massing, and they may merely reflect a preference to restudy closer to the test.},

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.   BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

  abstract = {Sleep promotes the consolidation of declarative as well as procedural and emotional memories in a wide variety of tasks. Sleep improves preferentially the consolidation of memories that were encoded explicitly and are behaviourally relevant to the individual.Consolidation during sleep not only strengthens memory traces quantitatively but can also produce qualitative changes in memory representations. An active process of re-organization enables the formation of new associations and the extraction of generalized features. This can ease novel inferences and insights.Spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal activity during encoding in the awake state become re-activated during subsequent sleep, specifically during slow-wave sleep (SWS) which is a state of minimum cholinergic activity. Such re-activations might promote the gradual redistribution of hippocampus-dependent memories from the hippocampus to neocortical sites for long-term storage (system consolidation) and might also trigger enduring synaptic changes to stabilize memories (synaptic consolidation).Neocortical ({$<$}1 Hz) slow oscillations, thalamo-cortical spindles and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples are implicated in memory consolidation during SWS. The depolarizing up-states of the slow oscillations synchronously drive the generation of spindles and ripples accompanying hippocampal memory re-activations, thus providing a temporal frame for a fine-tuned hippocampus-to-neocortex transfer of memories.Neocortical slow oscillations concurrently support a global synaptic downscaling that precludes saturation of synaptic networks and improves the capacity to encode new information.Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by a local upregulation of plasticity-related immediate early genes in the presence of high cholinergic activity and reduced electroencephalographic coherence between brain regions. These conditions might effectively support local synaptic consolidation.The temporal sequence of SWS and REM sleep in the normal sleep cycle suggests that these sleep stages have complementary roles in memory consolidation: during SWS, system consolidation promotes the re-activation and redistribution of select memory traces for long-term storage, whereas ensuing REM sleep might act to stabilize the transformed memories by enabling undisturbed synaptic consolidation.},

The textbook account of consolidation is that for any item in memory, consolidation starts and ends just once. Recently, a heated debate has been revitalized on whether this is indeed the case, or, alternatively, whether memories become labile and must undergo some form of renewed consolidation every time they are activated. This debate focuses attention on fundamental issues concerning the nature of the memory trace, its maturation, persistence, retrievability, and modifiability.},

In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice.},

In contrast, our MemReflex system of adaptive flashcards gives fast-feedback by retesting new items in quick succession, dynamically scheduling future tests according to a model of the learner's memory. We evaluate MemReflex across three user studies. In the first two studies, we demonstrate its effectiveness for both audio and text modalities, even while walking and distracted. In the third study of second-language vocabulary learning, we show how MemReflex enhanced learner accuracy, confidence, and perceptions of control and success.

Ebbinghaus has predominantly focused on the fact of forgetting, creating the impression that memory inevitably decreases with time or time-correlated interpolated events. Recent laboratory work on the recall of pictures, however, has suggested that memory for certain classes of stimuli may be hypermnesic rather than amnesic, increasing over time and recall attempts. The present study attempted to determine the magnitude of memory growth over more significant time intervals. Tests of memory up to 1 wk, in 1 and 6 Ss, indicated substantial growth of recall for pictures, but not usually for words. The outcomes are discussed in terms of (a) their bearing on the Ebbinghaus experimental tradition; (b) the relation of this study to other hypermnesia literature, including P. B. Ballard's reminiscence, hypnotic hypermnesia, memory recoveries in therapy, and the Penfield effect; and (c) the implications of hypermnesia for psychodynamics and unconscious processes.

Less well-known clinical and laboratory traditions suggest, however, that memory can also increase over time. Ballard (1913) demonstrated that, actually, memory simultaneously increases and decreases over time and thus has not 1 but 2 tendencies. When more than 1 recall test is administered, a later test invariably shows loss of some items remembered earlier (oblivescence), but later tests also invariably show that previously unremembered items are recovered in later tests (reminiscence). Depending on a number of factors (e.g., the stimulus used), the overall balance between reminiscence and oblivescence may be positive (hypermnesia) or negative (amnesia). Modern multitrial recall studies have extensively documented hypermnesic memory in single laboratory sessions and, also, although less frequently, over periods of days, weeks, and even months. With hypermnesic memory now established, hypnosis has been shown not to add anything to regular hypermnesia. This article presents an integration of the scattered literatures, which now, after a century of experimental and clinical effort, coheres into a solid empirical picture, with numerous implications (e.g., for the recovered memory controversy, eyewitness testimony, repression, and subliminal perception).

While there have been extensive studies in designing optimal schedules for teaching a single concept given a learner's memory model, existing approaches for teaching multiple concepts are typically based on heuristic scheduling techniques without theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we look at the problem from the perspective of discrete optimization and introduce a novel algorithmic framework for teaching multiple concepts with strong performance guarantees. Our framework is both generic, allowing the design of teaching schedules for different memory models, and also interactive, allowing the teacher to adapt the schedule to the underlying forgetting mechanisms of the learner. Furthermore, for a well-known memory model, we are able to identify a regime of model parameters where our framework is guaranteed to achieve high performance. We perform extensive evaluations using simulations along with real user studies in two concrete applications: (i) an educational app for online vocabulary teaching; and (ii) an app for teaching novices how to recognize animal species from images. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to popular heuristic approaches.},

The curve for forgetting during sleep has a short initial decline, after which a constant level is maintained, while that for the periods of waking takes the familiar form of a continued decline which is negatively accelerated. This divergence in the rate of forgetting during sleep and waking accounts for the variations found in the curves of forgetting of earlier investigators. From Psych Bulletin 22:09:00714.

Instead of debating the amount of time that should be spent in school (and on schoolwork), this article addresses how the available instructional time might be optimally utilized via the scheduling of review or practice. Hundreds of studies in cognitive and educational psychology have demonstrated that spacing out repeated encounters with the material over time produces superior long-term learning, compared with repetitions that are massed together. Also, incorporating tests into spaced practice amplifies the benefits. Spaced review or practice enhances diverse forms of learning, including memory, problem solving, and generalization to new situations. Spaced practice is a feasible and cost-effective way to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning, and has tremendous potential to improve educational outcomes. The article also discusses barriers to adopting spaced practice, recent developments, and their possible implications.},

The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes.

  journal = {Quizlet},
  abstract = {Here at Quizlet, our goal is to help students practice and master whatever they're learning \textemdash{} and to do it as efficiently as possible. Research shows that the most effective way to learn involves spreading study out over a long period of time and reviewing terms with longer and longer delays each time, a process known as spaced repetition. However, students don't always have the luxury of spending days or weeks repeatedly reviewing material. They've got a test tomorrow, and they need to learn the material now. So our challenge is: How can we present learning material so students are always focusing on whatever they need to work on the most? With that goal in mind, we set out to build a brand new framework for choosing and ordering terms to study on Quizlet. We call it the Learning Assistant Platform. It powers the new Learn, which launches today on iOS, and soon on Android and Web! We aim to have this algorithm drive the question selection for many of the learning experiences on Quizlet. Existing Solutions Classic Quizlet Learn The original Quizlet Learn had a very simple algorithm: Answer one question for every term, repeat all the questions you got wrong, and continue until you've gotten each question correct. This is a great start, but it's usually not enough to be ready for a test. We took a look at a small sample of all the answers on Quizlet and saw that after getting a term correct on the first try, once a user sees it a second time (whenever that may be), there's only about an 87\% chance they'll get it right. And if it took a few tries to get right, that number drops much lower: below 70\%. Students could keep studying by restarting Learn from the beginning, but now they're spending a lot of time re-studying terms they already know fairly well instead of focusing on the ones that need more work. That's not the most efficient use of time, and we knew we could improve on that. Long-Term Learning About a year ago, Quizlet launched Long-Term Learning. Long-Term Learning uses a standard spaced repetition algorithm, similar to SuperMemo or Anki. It works something like this: Introduce a few new terms each day Study all of the day's terms until you get them all correct, then study the new terms again the next day Each time a term is answered correctly, increase the delay until it's studied again by a little more than double (Study 1 day later, 3 days after that, then 7 days, 16 days, etc.) If a term is answered incorrectly, start over and reset the delay for that term to 1 day Long-Term Learning works great when there's no particular deadline for when a student needs to finish learning the material. By deferring review of each term until just as it's about to be forgotten, Long-Term Learning minimizes the effort needed to commit the terms to long-term memory. However, it won't allow students to study all their terms in a single day, nor to review a term after they've already studied it in a given day. This is great for the students who have long-term study goals. However, the majority of Quizlet users only study a set on a single day; 95\% study a set over four days at most, which is still too few for the Long-Term Learning algorithm to be effective. Cramming is a reality for many students, and we want to help them make the best of their study time however they spend it. Our Approach A key idea behind spaced repetition is that a student should always study a term just before they're about to forget it, when there's about an 80\% chance to get the answer correct. But at Quizlet we can't wait long enough for students to almost forget some terms. Many students don't have the time, and even if they did, we wouldn't want them going into a test with only an 81\% chance of getting the answers right! So instead, our new Learning Assistant algorithm prioritizes the terms we think students are closest to forgetting, the terms we think the student is least likely to get correct. So every question a student sees is always on one of the few terms that need the most work, and within that framework, we can build a term scheduling algorithm that works well for any time scale. So how do we know which terms a student is most likely to forget? That's where machine learning comes into play. Quizlet has tens of millions of users who have submitted tens of billions of answers on billions of terms. For each user's answer, we know which term they were studying, what time they answered it, and whether they got the question correct or incorrect. We started by sampling a small subset of about 1.5 million answers from our database and grouped them into streaks for each user, on each term. Then we looked for patterns that correlate with higher or lower recall probability \textemdash{} a user's chance to answer a term correctly at a given time. Finally, we were able to use that model in our new Learning Assistant algorithm to predict recall probability and prioritize the lowest scored terms. Identifying the Features Any machine learning algorithm must start by identifying ``features'': Pieces of information from which the algorithm can learn to make predictions. Our algorithm has four main features we use to predict recall probability: Correctness of answers Time since last answer Time between previous answers Direction of study Answer Correctness Three answers, two incorrect, and one correct Unsurprisingly, the single strongest predictor of whether the next question will be answered correctly is whether or not the most recent answer for the term was correct. But whether or not older answers were correct is also very important. The farther back the answer was, the less it influences the chances of getting the upcoming question correct. Two wrong answers followed by a correct answer is very different from a correct answer followed by two wrong answers. Recall probability for all possible answer sequences up to three deep This feature is the key to allowing us to determine what terms need to be reviewed the most, even if they were all studied very recently. Forgetting Curve: Time Since Last Question Three answers, some time ago The longer it's been since a student saw a term, the less likely they are to remember it. This is known to follow an exponential decay function, called the forgetting curve. The forgetting curve is one of two key cognitive science principles that inform the design of all spaced repetition algorithms. Here's our model of the forgetting curve for a typical case: Our predictions of recall probability will decay over time as the student starts to forget a term, leading us to prioritize terms that haven't been studied recently. Spacing Effect: Time Between Previous Questions Three answers, with some delay between the most recent two The more a student spaces out their study, the better they'll remember the material. This is known as the spacing effect. This is another cognitive science principle behind the idea of spaced repetition. We measure the time between the previous two answers, and like the forgetting curve, we assume an exponential relationship. If students space their study out over longer periods of time, as opposed to cramming in a single sitting, we'll expect them to remember the terms better, and won't need to ask them to study the terms as many times. Study Direction Just because a student can remember the English definition for a Spanish word doesn't necessarily mean they'll be able to remember the Spanish word when given the English definition. We treat each direction you can study a term as separate but related facts. If a student only studies a term in one direction, they'll be less likely to get that term correct in the other direction. As a result, we tend to ask the question side the student has seen and gotten correct less often, making sure the student learns the term front and back! The Model Finally, with all these features derived from over a million answers, we trained a machine learning model to predict recall probability using logistic regression. Logistic regression finds an equation that takes each of the features as an input and returns a number between 0 and 1. For us, 0 represents an incorrect answer and 1 represents a correct answer. Logistic regression attempts to minimize the error between the predictions it generates and the actual observed results. We can interpret these predictions as recall probability, which then we use to determine the best ordering of questions. Our model performed pretty well! A standard approach for evaluating a model like this is the AUROC metric. A value of 1 would indicate perfect predictions, and 0.5 would indicate random guessing. Our AUROC was 0.815, which is pretty good. Because we know our predictions are fairly accurate, we can be confident that the lowest scored terms really are the ones that need the most work. While there are other, more sophisticated machine learning algorithms available, we chose logistic regression for two reasons: First, it produces a very simple, easy to interpret model, allowing us to understand and quantify how these variables affect learning. Second, and more important for us, is model portability. Quizlet is used in many different environments around the world \textemdash{} on the road, in developing countries, and in schools with limited network capacity. Our goal is to make quality learning tools accessible to every student, so robust offline support in our mobile apps is a priority. Logistic regression produces a simple equation that we can transcribe to a JavaScript module that we can use on the website and compile into both the iOS and Android apps, putting the power of machine learning in your pocket! Future Improvements Now that we've launched this for new Learn, we're excited to see the results and improve on them. Within this framework, there's a lot more we can do to make the algorithm even better! Here's some of the ideas we have in mind: Better modeling of different question types Before now, Quizlet hasn't had a learning experience with the mix of question types we have in the new Learn (which includes multiple choice, self-assessment flashcards, and others). We trained our model on old Learn, which includes only written questions, so it isn't able to capture the fact that multiple choice questions are easier than written questions, for example. Once we develop a model for the new question types, we'll be able to quantify how well studying with each question type prepares a student to answer written questions. Measuring inherent difficulty of terms Some terms are just going to be harder than others, regardless of how they're studied or who's studying them. For example, one might expect words with irregular spellings to be more difficult to remember. We can look at each word that's commonly studied on Quizlet, measure how often users get it correct, and use that to make better term ordering decisions, even for people who haven't started studying the material. Improving behavior over longer periods of time Because our algorithm is based on the principles of spaced repetition, it should in theory behave like other spaced repetition algorithms and, over the course of many days, introduce longer and longer delays between each time a term is studied. However, in practice, because we assumed a simple exponential decay forgetting curve and trained our model on a random sample of Quizlet data which is heavily biased towards time ranges of under a couple days, our model isn't very sensitive to time changes over longer periods of time. But we can address that by sampling our data to include more long-term study behavior, and by modelling the time components more flexibly (not assuming a strict exponential relationship). That will allow us to build an algorithm that works great whether a student crams studying ten terms the night before a test, or spends years studying thousands of terms. Moving Forward The Quizlet Learning Assistant Platform paves the way forward for more intelligent and efficient learning on Quizlet. The classic Learn algorithm is simple but not efficient, and the Long-Term Learning algorithm only works well for students without deadlines. By using machine learning to build a predictive model informed by the same cognitive science theories behind spaced repetition, we were able to build an algorithm that makes studying efficient and practical for all our users. We're excited to launch this as part of the new Learn, and we're looking forward to continuing to improve it in the future!},

The relative benefit of spacing increased with increased practice and with longer retention intervals. Data were fitted with an activation-based memory model, which proposes that each time an item is practiced it receives an increment of strength but that these increments decay as a power function of time. The rate of decay for each presentation depended on the activation at the time of the presentation. This mechanism limits long-term benefits from further practice at higher levels of activation and produces the spacing effect and its observed interactions with practice and retention interval. The model was compared with another model of the spacing effect (Raaijmakers, 2003) and was fit to some results from the literature on spacing and memory.},

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75\% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.},

Online learning platforms like Khan Academy and Duolingo tackle this problem in part by using interaction data to estimate student proficiency and recommend content. While the literature proposes a variety of algorithms for modeling student learning, there is relatively little work on principled methods for sequentially choosing items for the student to review in order to maximize learning. We study this decision problem as an instance of reinforcement learning, and draw on recent advances in training deep neural networks to learn flexible and scalable teaching policies that select the next item to review. Our primary contribution is an analysis of a model-free review scheduling algorithm for spaced repetition systems that does not explicitly model the student, and instead learns a policy that directly operates on raw observations of the study history. As a preliminary study, we train and evaluate this method using a student simulator based on cognitive models of human memory. Results show that modelfree scheduling is competitive against widely-used heuristics like SuperMemo and the Leitner system on various learning objectives and student models.},

This plays a crucial role in the design of educational software, leading to a trade-off between teaching new material and reviewing what has already been taught. A common way to balance this trade-off is spaced repetition, which uses periodic review of content to improve long-term retention. Though spaced repetition is widely used in practice, e.g., in electronic flashcard software, there is little formal understanding of the design of these systems. Our paper addresses this gap in three ways. First, we mine log data from spaced repetition software to establish the functional dependence of retention on reinforcement and delay. Second, we use this memory model to develop a stochastic model for spaced repetition systems. We propose a queueing network model of the Leitner system for reviewing flashcards, along with a heuristic approximation that admits a tractable optimization problem for review scheduling. Finally, we empirically evaluate our queueing model through a Mechanical Turk experiment, verifying a key qualitative prediction of our model: the existence of a sharp phase transition in learning outcomes upon increasing the rate of new item introductions.},

Since players can answer the question at any time, an elite player (human or machine) demonstrates its superiority by answering correctly given as few clues as possible. We make two key contributions to machine learning research through Quizbowl: (1) collecting and curating a large factoid QA dataset and an accompanying gameplay dataset, and (2) developing a computational approach to playing Quizbowl that involves determining both what to answer and when to answer. Our Quizbowl system has defeated some of the best trivia players in the world over a multi-year series of exhibition matches. Throughout this paper, we show that collaborations with the vibrant Quizbowl community have contributed to the high quality of our dataset, led to new research directions, and doubled as an exciting way to engage the public with research in machine learning and natural language processing.},

In this article, we selectively review laboratory studies that reveal the power of testing in improving retention and then turn to studies that demonstrate the basic effects in educational settings. We also consider the related concepts of dynamic testing and formative assessment as other means of using tests to improve learning. Finally, we consider some negative consequences of testing that may occur in certain circumstances, though these negative effects are often small and do not cancel out the large positive effects of testing.

No empirical law withstands manipulation across the four sets of factors that Jenkins (1979) identified as critical to memory experiments: types of subjects, kinds of events to be remembered, manipulation of encoding conditions, and variations in test conditions. Another factor affecting many phenomena is whether a manipulation of conditions occurs in randomized, within-subjects designs rather than between-subjects (or within-subject, blocked) designs. The fact that simple laws do not hold reveals the complex, interactive nature of memory phenomena. Nonetheless, the science of memory is robust, with most findings easily replicated under the same conditions as originally used, but when other variables are manipulated, effects may disappear or reverse. These same points are probably true of psychological research in most, if not all, domains.},

Students then took a final retention test 5 min, 2 days, or 1 week later. When the final test was given after 5 min, repeated studying improved recall relative to repeated testing.

Though both systems used the same algorithm for sequencing materials, QuizBot led to students recognizing (and recalling) over 20\% more correct answers than when students used the flashcard app. Using a conversational agent is more time consuming to practice with; but in a second study, of their own volition, students spent 2.6x more time learning with QuizBot than with flashcards and reported preferring it strongly for casual learning. Our results in this second study showed QuizBot yielded improved learning gains over flashcards on recall. These results suggest that educational chatbot systems may have beneficial use, particularly for learning outside of traditional settings.},

  abstract = {As critical as waking brain function is to learning and memory, an established literature now describes an equally important yet complementary role for sleep in information processing. This overview examines the specific contribution of sleep to human hippocampal memory processing; both the detriments caused by a lack of sleep, and conversely, the proactive benefits that develop following the presence of sleep. First, a role for sleep before learning is discussed, preparing the hippocampus for initial memory encoding. Second, a role for sleep after learning is considered, modulating the post-encoding consolidation of hippocampal-dependent memory. Third, a model is outlined in which these encoding and consolidation operations are symbiotically accomplished, associated with specific NREM sleep physiological oscillations. As a result, the optimal network outcome is achieved: increasing hippocampal independence and hence overnight consolidation, while restoring next-day sparse hippocampal encoding capacity for renewed learning ability upon awakening. Finally, emerging evidence is considered suggesting that, unlike previous conceptions, sleep does not universally consolidate all information. Instead, and based on explicit as well as saliency cues during initial encoding, sleep executes the discriminatory offline consolidation only of select information. Consequently, sleep promotes the targeted strengthening of some memories while actively forgetting others; a proposal with significant theoretical and clinical ramifications.},

Delay interval variation was achieved by arranging five different sets of five delays across daily sessions. In different conditions, the delays were distributed in arithmetic or logarithmic series. There was no convincing evidence for different effects on discriminability of the distributions of different delays. The mean data were better fitted by some mathematical functions than by others, but the best-fitting functions depended on the distribution of delays. In further conditions with a fixed set of five delays, discriminability was higher with a logarithmic distribution of delays than with an arithmetic distribution. This result is consistent with the treatment of the forgetting function in terms of generalization decrement.},

  abstract = {DESCRIPTION This is a reflective essay and report on my experiences using Spaced Repetition  Software (SRS) in an American high school classroom. It follows my 2015 and 2016  posts on the same topic. Because I value concise summaries in non-fiction, I provide one immediately below. However, I also believe in the power of narrative, in carefully unfolding a story so as to maximize reader engagement and impact. As I have applied such narrative considerations in writing this post, I consider the following summary to be a spoiler. I'll let you decide what to do with that information. SUMMARY (SPOILERS) My earlier push for classroom SRS solutions was driven by a belief I came to see as fallacious: that forgetting is the undoing of learning. This epistemic shift drove me to abandon designs for a custom app that would have integrated whole-class and individual SRS functions. While I still see value in classroom use of Spaced Repetition Software, especially in basic language acquisition, I have greatly reduced its use in my own classes. In my third year of experiments (2016-17), I used a windfall of classroom computers to give students supervised time to independently study using an SRS app with individual profiles. I found longer-term average performance to be slightly worse than under the whole-class group study model, though students of high intelligence and motivation saw slight improvements. INTRO AND RESPONSE TO PIOTR WO\'ZNIAK I have recently received a number of requests to revisit the topic of classroom SRS after years of silence on the subject. Understandably, the term ``postmortem'' has come up more than once. Did I hit a dead end? Do I still use it? Also, I was informed that SRS founding father Piotr Wo\'zniak recently added a page to his SuperMemo wiki in which he quoted me at length and claimed that SRS doesn't belong in the classroom. Well, I don't have much in the way of rebuttal, because Wo\'zniak's main goal with the page seems to be to use my experience a},

Computational models of the implicated signalling cascades have predicted that spaced training with irregular inter-trial intervals can enhance learning.

Furthermore, examination of the learning curves provides actionable insights into how different segments of the student population are learning. To make our mixture model more expressive, we allow the learning curves to be defined by generalized linear models with arbitrary features.

However, current spaced repetition algorithms are simple rule-based heuristics with a few hard-coded parameters. Here, we introduce a flexible representation of spaced repetition using the framework of marked temporal point processes and then address the design of spaced repetition algorithms with provable guarantees as an optimal control problem for stochastic differential equations with jumps. For two well-known human memory models, we show that, if the learner aims to maximize recall probability of the content to be learned subject to a cost on the reviewing frequency, the optimal reviewing schedule is given by the recall probability itself. As a result, we can then develop a simple, scalable online spaced repetition algorithm, MEMORIZE, to determine the optimal reviewing times. We perform a large-scale natural experiment using data from Duolingo, a popular language-learning online platform, and show that learners who follow a reviewing schedule determined by our algorithm memorize more effectively than learners who follow alternative schedules determined by several heuristics.},

An analysis of the current evidence suggests that the classical Ebbinghaus curve of forgetting is primarily a function of interference from materials learned previously in the laboratory. When this source of interference is removed, forgetting decreases from about 75 per cent over 24 hours to about 25 per cent. This latter figure can be reduced by a least 10 per cent by other methodological considerations, leaving 15 per cent as an estimate of the forgetting over 24 hours. This estimate will vary somewhat as a function of intratask similarity, distributed practice, and with very low meaningful material. But the overall evidence suggests that similarity with other material and situational similarity are by far the most critical factors in forgetting. Such evidence is consonant with a general interference theory, although the details of such a theory were not presented here." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
