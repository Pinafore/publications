	abstract = {The spacing effect—that is, the benefit of spacing learning events apart rather than massing them together—has been demonstrated in hundreds of experiments, but is not well known to educators or learners. I investigated the spacing effect in the realistic context of flashcard use. Learners often divide flashcards into relatively small stacks, but compared to a large stack, small stacks decrease the spacing between study trials. In three experiments, participants used a web-based study programme to learn GRE-type word pairs. Studying one large stack of flashcards (i.e. spacing) was more effective than studying four smaller stacks of flashcards separately (i.e. massing). Spacing was also more effective than cramming—that is, massing study on the last day before the test. Across experiments, spacing was more effective than massing for 90\% of the participants, yet after the first study session, 72\% of the participants believed that massing had been more effective than spacing.

	abstract = {In the study of human learning, there is broad evidence that our ability to retain information improves with repeated exposure and decays with delay since last exposure. This plays a crucial role in the design of educational software, leading to a trade-oﬀ between teaching new material and reviewing what has already been taught. A common way to balance this trade-oﬀ is spaced repetition, which uses periodic review of content to improve long-term retention. Though spaced repetition is widely used in practice, e.g., in electronic ﬂashcard software, there is little formal understanding of the design of these systems. Our paper addresses this gap in three ways. First, we mine log data from spaced repetition software to establish the functional dependence of retention on reinforcement and delay. Second, we use this memory model to develop a stochastic model for spaced repetition systems. We propose a queueing network model of the Leitner system for reviewing ﬂashcards, along with a heuristic approximation that admits a tractable optimization problem for review scheduling. Finally, we empirically evaluate our queueing model through a Mechanical Turk experiment, verifying a key qualitative prediction of our model: the existence of a sharp phase transition in learning outcomes upon increasing the rate of new item introductions.},

	abstract = {Flashcard systems typically help students learn facts (e.g., definitions, names, and dates), relying on intense initial memoriztion with subsequent tests delayed up to days later. This approach does not exploit the short, sparse, and mobile opportunities for microlearning throughout the day, nor does it support learners who need the motivation that comes from successful study sessions. In contrast, our MemReflex system of adaptive flashcards gives fast-feedback by retesting new items in quick succession, dynamically scheduling future tests according to a model of the learner’s memory. We evaluate MemReflex across three user studies. In the first two studies, we demonstrate its effectiveness for both audio and text modalities, even while walking and distracted. In the third study of second-language vocabulary learning, we show how MemReflex enhanced learner accuracy, confidence, and perceptions of control and success. Overall, the work suggests new directions for mobile microlearning and “micro activities” in general.},

However, less research has been conducted to explore correlations between pedagogic interventions to increase vocabulary knowledge and score gains on standardized L2 proficiency tests. This study addresses this gap in the research by analyzing the relationship between extended study of a Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) word list using spaced repetition software (SRS) and TOEIC score gains. Two classes of Japanese students totaling 60 participants were encouraged to study a TOEIC word list using SRS for 10 months. TOEIC score gains from a pre-test to a post-test were then correlated with the number of flashcard repetitions to investigate the relationship between SRS study and test score gains. Statistically significant relationships (p {\textless} 0.05) were found between total SRS repetitions and TOEIC listening and overall score gains. Total word list reviews accounted for 11.4\% of the variance in overall TOEIC gains, 6.2\% of the variance in reading gain and 7.2\% of the variance in listening gains. The authors argue that study of test-specific word lists with SRS may be a useful addition to motivated students' test preparation strategies for standardized foreign language proficiency tests.},

Presentation intervals are longer for items presented more often and already learned. But even these items are presented in order to avoid forgetting them over time.

Integrating this content selection strategy in (mobile) learning games does not only foster learning in a more efficient way, it also keeps learners/players more motivated as their performance increases over time.

	abstract = {Spaced repetition is a technique for efficient memorization which uses repeated review of content following a schedule determined by a spaced repetition algorithm to improve long-term retention. However, current spaced repetition algorithms are simple rule-based heuristics with a few hard-coded parameters. Here, we introduce a flexible representation of spaced repetition using the framework of marked temporal point processes and then address the design of spaced repetition algorithms with provable guarantees as an optimal control problem for stochastic differential equations with jumps. For two well-known human memory models, we show that, if the learner aims to maximize recall probability of the content to be learned subject to a cost on the reviewing frequency, the optimal reviewing schedule is given by the recall probability itself. As a result, we can then develop a simple, scalable online spaced repetition algorithm, MEMORIZE, to determine the optimal reviewing times. We perform a large-scale natural experiment using data from Duolingo, a popular language-learning online platform, and show that learners who follow a reviewing schedule determined by our algorithm memorize more effectively than learners who follow alternative schedules determined by several heuristics.},

The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes.

	abstract = {Here at Quizlet, our goal is to help students practice and master whatever they’re learning — and to do it as efficiently as possible. Research shows that the most effective way to learn involves spreading study out over a long period of time and reviewing terms with longer and longer delays each time, a process known as spaced repetition. However, students don’t always have the luxury of spending days or weeks repeatedly reviewing material. They’ve got a test tomorrow, and they need to learn the material now. So our challenge is: How can we present learning material so students are always focusing on whatever they need to work on the most? With that goal in mind, we set out to build a brand new framework for choosing and ordering terms to study on Quizlet. We call it the Learning Assistant Platform. It powers the new Learn, which launches today on iOS, and soon on Android and Web! We aim to have this algorithm drive the question selection for many of the learning experiences on Quizlet. Existing Solutions Classic Quizlet Learn The original Quizlet Learn had a very simple algorithm: Answer one question for every term, repeat all the questions you got wrong, and continue until you’ve gotten each question correct. This is a great start, but it’s usually not enough to be ready for a test. We took a look at a small sample of all the answers on Quizlet and saw that after getting a term correct on the first try, once a user sees it a second time (whenever that may be), there’s only about an 87\% chance they’ll get it right. And if it took a few tries to get right, that number drops much lower: below 70\%. Students could keep studying by restarting Learn from the beginning, but now they’re spending a lot of time re-studying terms they already know fairly well instead of focusing on the ones that need more work. That’s not the most efficient use of time, and we knew we could improve on that. Long-Term Learning About a year ago, Quizlet launched Long-Term Learning. Long-Term Learning uses a standard spaced repetition algorithm, similar to SuperMemo or Anki. It works something like this: Introduce a few new terms each day Study all of the day’s terms until you get them all correct, then study the new terms again the next day Each time a term is answered correctly, increase the delay until it’s studied again by a little more than double (Study 1 day later, 3 days after that, then 7 days, 16 days, etc.) If a term is answered incorrectly, start over and reset the delay for that term to 1 day Long-Term Learning works great when there’s no particular deadline for when a student needs to finish learning the material. By deferring review of each term until just as it’s about to be forgotten, Long-Term Learning minimizes the effort needed to commit the terms to long-term memory. However, it won’t allow students to study all their terms in a single day, nor to review a term after they’ve already studied it in a given day. This is great for the students who have long-term study goals. However, the majority of Quizlet users only study a set on a single day; 95\% study a set over four days at most, which is still too few for the Long-Term Learning algorithm to be effective. Cramming is a reality for many students, and we want to help them make the best of their study time however they spend it. Our Approach A key idea behind spaced repetition is that a student should always study a term just before they’re about to forget it, when there’s about an 80\% chance to get the answer correct. But at Quizlet we can’t wait long enough for students to almost forget some terms. Many students don’t have the time, and even if they did, we wouldn’t want them going into a test with only an 81\% chance of getting the answers right! So instead, our new Learning Assistant algorithm prioritizes the terms we think students are closest to forgetting, the terms we think the student is least likely to get correct. So every question a student sees is always on one of the few terms that need the most work, and within that framework, we can build a term scheduling algorithm that works well for any time scale. So how do we know which terms a student is most likely to forget? That’s where machine learning comes into play. Quizlet has tens of millions of users who have submitted tens of billions of answers on billions of terms. For each user’s answer, we know which term they were studying, what time they answered it, and whether they got the question correct or incorrect. We started by sampling a small subset of about 1.5 million answers from our database and grouped them into streaks for each user, on each term. Then we looked for patterns that correlate with higher or lower recall probability — a user’s chance to answer a term correctly at a given time. Finally, we were able to use that model in our new Learning Assistant algorithm to predict recall probability and prioritize the lowest scored terms. Identifying the Features Any machine learning algorithm must start by identifying “features”: Pieces of information from which the algorithm can learn to make predictions. Our algorithm has four main features we use to predict recall probability: Correctness of answers Time since last answer Time between previous answers Direction of study Answer Correctness Three answers, two incorrect, and one correct Unsurprisingly, the single strongest predictor of whether the next question will be answered correctly is whether or not the most recent answer for the term was correct. But whether or not older answers were correct is also very important. The farther back the answer was, the less it influences the chances of getting the upcoming question correct. Two wrong answers followed by a correct answer is very different from a correct answer followed by two wrong answers. Recall probability for all possible answer sequences up to three deep This feature is the key to allowing us to determine what terms need to be reviewed the most, even if they were all studied very recently. Forgetting Curve: Time Since Last Question Three answers, some time ago The longer it’s been since a student saw a term, the less likely they are to remember it. This is known to follow an exponential decay function, called the forgetting curve. The forgetting curve is one of two key cognitive science principles that inform the design of all spaced repetition algorithms. Here’s our model of the forgetting curve for a typical case: Our predictions of recall probability will decay over time as the student starts to forget a term, leading us to prioritize terms that haven’t been studied recently. Spacing Effect: Time Between Previous Questions Three answers, with some delay between the most recent two The more a student spaces out their study, the better they’ll remember the material. This is known as the spacing effect. This is another cognitive science principle behind the idea of spaced repetition. We measure the time between the previous two answers, and like the forgetting curve, we assume an exponential relationship. If students space their study out over longer periods of time, as opposed to cramming in a single sitting, we’ll expect them to remember the terms better, and won’t need to ask them to study the terms as many times. Study Direction Just because a student can remember the English definition for a Spanish word doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll be able to remember the Spanish word when given the English definition. We treat each direction you can study a term as separate but related facts. If a student only studies a term in one direction, they’ll be less likely to get that term correct in the other direction. As a result, we tend to ask the question side the student has seen and gotten correct less often, making sure the student learns the term front and back! The Model Finally, with all these features derived from over a million answers, we trained a machine learning model to predict recall probability using logistic regression. Logistic regression finds an equation that takes each of the features as an input and returns a number between 0 and 1. For us, 0 represents an incorrect answer and 1 represents a correct answer. Logistic regression attempts to minimize the error between the predictions it generates and the actual observed results. We can interpret these predictions as recall probability, which then we use to determine the best ordering of questions. Our model performed pretty well! A standard approach for evaluating a model like this is the AUROC metric. A value of 1 would indicate perfect predictions, and 0.5 would indicate random guessing. Our AUROC was 0.815, which is pretty good. Because we know our predictions are fairly accurate, we can be confident that the lowest scored terms really are the ones that need the most work. While there are other, more sophisticated machine learning algorithms available, we chose logistic regression for two reasons: First, it produces a very simple, easy to interpret model, allowing us to understand and quantify how these variables affect learning. Second, and more important for us, is model portability. Quizlet is used in many different environments around the world — on the road, in developing countries, and in schools with limited network capacity. Our goal is to make quality learning tools accessible to every student, so robust offline support in our mobile apps is a priority. Logistic regression produces a simple equation that we can transcribe to a JavaScript module that we can use on the website and compile into both the iOS and Android apps, putting the power of machine learning in your pocket! Future Improvements Now that we’ve launched this for new Learn, we’re excited to see the results and improve on them. Within this framework, there’s a lot more we can do to make the algorithm even better! Here’s some of the ideas we have in mind: Better modeling of different question types Before now, Quizlet hasn’t had a learning experience with the mix of question types we have in the new Learn (which includes multiple choice, self-assessment flashcards, and others). We trained our model on old Learn, which includes only written questions, so it isn’t able to capture the fact that multiple choice questions are easier than written questions, for example. Once we develop a model for the new question types, we’ll be able to quantify how well studying with each question type prepares a student to answer written questions. Measuring inherent difficulty of terms Some terms are just going to be harder than others, regardless of how they’re studied or who’s studying them. For example, one might expect words with irregular spellings to be more difficult to remember. We can look at each word that’s commonly studied on Quizlet, measure how often users get it correct, and use that to make better term ordering decisions, even for people who haven’t started studying the material. Improving behavior over longer periods of time Because our algorithm is based on the principles of spaced repetition, it should in theory behave like other spaced repetition algorithms and, over the course of many days, introduce longer and longer delays between each time a term is studied. However, in practice, because we assumed a simple exponential decay forgetting curve and trained our model on a random sample of Quizlet data which is heavily biased towards time ranges of under a couple days, our model isn’t very sensitive to time changes over longer periods of time. But we can address that by sampling our data to include more long-term study behavior, and by modelling the time components more flexibly (not assuming a strict exponential relationship). That will allow us to build an algorithm that works great whether a student crams studying ten terms the night before a test, or spends years studying thousands of terms. Moving Forward The Quizlet Learning Assistant Platform paves the way forward for more intelligent and efficient learning on Quizlet. The classic Learn algorithm is simple but not efficient, and the Long-Term Learning algorithm only works well for students without deadlines. By using machine learning to build a predictive model informed by the same cognitive science theories behind spaced repetition, we were able to build an algorithm that makes studying efficient and practical for all our users. We’re excited to launch this as part of the new Learn, and we’re looking forward to continuing to improve it in the future!},

In this study, we use PACARD to evaluate the effectiveness of card-based design on personalized adaptive mobile learning. An empirical study was conducted among 2774 online users for three months to evaluate PACARD's effect on engaging active recall, thus, enhancing memory retention. We also observed how our adaptive mechanism meets user preference. In terms of memory retention and users' preference in PACARD, it results in better retention and it also enabled the learning items to be more appealing to the users as the users related to their own learning progress.},

Starting in 1998 with 16 regional sites, the competition has grown to 25 sites in 2016 with more than 2000 students and 400 schools participating each year and having involved more than 18,000 students nationwide since its inception. Regional sites are primarily at research universities, aquariums, or science centres. Each regional site sends a team to a central site for the national competition. The NOSB grew out of an overlapping vision for enhanced formal and informal ocean education. This vision was shared by multiple government agencies at the national and states levels in the USA, and by universities, local and state science agencies, informal science education centres (museums, zoos, public aquariums), and by many other educators. The alignment of shared missions, visions, and objectives allowed these disparate organisations to find creative funding mechanisms. This support created an enduring, shared programming that currently provides enormous leverage for future national and international STEM education efforts. Seventeen years of research findings on the NOSB programme have indicated clearly that the NOSB is more than an academic competition. It is a rich and complex interaction of a variety of stakeholders who benefit from their involvement in the programme in positive ways. It is a powerful social system in support of ocean science learning and stewardship, which has produced numerous STEM professionals and researchers who are now engaged in some dimension of the STEM employment pipeline.},

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efﬁciently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75\% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.},
