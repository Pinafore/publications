    Mappings to structured output spaces (strings, trees, partitions,
    etc.) are typically learned using extensions of classification
    algorithms to simple graphical structures (eg., linear chains) in
    which search and parameter estimation can be performed exactly.
    Unfortunately, in many complex problems, it is rare that exact search
    or parameter estimation is tractable.  Instead of learning exact
    models and searching via heuristic means, we embrace this difficulty
    and treat the structured output problem in terms of approximate
    search.  We present a framework for learning as search optimization,
    and two parameter updates with convergence theorems and bounds.
    Empirical evidence shows that our integrated approach to learning and
    decoding can outperform exact models at smaller computational cost.

    We present Searn, an algorithm for integrating search and
    learning to solve complex structured prediction problems such
    as those that occur in natural language, speech, computational
    biology, and vision.  Searn is a meta-algorithm that transforms
    these complex problems into simple classification problems to which
    any binary classifier may be applied.  Unlike current algorithms for
    structured learning that require decomposition of both the loss
    function and the feature functions over the predicted structure,
    Searn is able to learn prediction functions for any loss
    function and any class of features.  Moreover, Searn comes
    with a strong, natural theoretical guarantee: good performance on the
    derived classification problems implies good performance on the
    structured prediction problem.

    Topic models have been studied extensively in the context of
    monolingual corpora. Though there are some attempts to mine topical
    structure from cross-lingual corpora, they require clues about document
    alignments. In this paper we present a generative model called JointLDA
    which uses a bilingual dictionary to mine multilingual topics from an
    unaligned corpus. Experiments conducted on different data sets confirm
    our conjecture that jointly modeling the cross-lingual corpora offers several
    advantages compared to individual monolingual models. Since the
    JointLDA model merges related topics in different languages into a single
    multilingual topic: a) it can fit the data with relatively fewer topics. b)
    it has the ability to predict related words from a language different than
    that of the given document. In fact it has better predictive power compared
    to the bag-of-word based translation model leaving the possibility
    for JointLDA to be preferred over bag-of-word model for cross-lingual
    IR applications. We also found that the monolingual models learnt while
    optimizing the cross-lingual copora are more effective than the corresponding

  abstract =     {
    Mapping documents into an interlingual representation
    can help bridge the language barrier
    of a cross-lingual corpus. Previous approaches
    use aligned documents as training
    data to learn an interlingual representation,
    making them sensitive to the domain of the
    training data. In this paper, we learn an interlingual
    representation in an unsupervised
    manner using only a bilingual dictionary. We
    first use the bilingual dictionary to find candidate
    document alignments and then use them
    to find an interlingual representation. Since
    the candidate alignments are noisy, we develop
    a robust learning algorithm to learn
    the interlingual representation. We show that
    bilingual dictionaries generalize to different
    domains better: our approach gives better performance
    than either a word by word translation
    method or Canonical Correlation Analysis
    (CCA) trained on a different domain.

    Topic models have great potential for helping users understand
    document corpora. This potential is stymied by their purely
    unsupervised nature, which often leads to topics that are neither
    entirely meaningful nor effective in extrinsic tasks (Chang et
    al., 2009). We propose a simple and effective way to guide topic
    models to learn topics of speciﬁc interest to a user. We achieve
    this by providing sets of seed words that a user believes are
    representative of the underlying topics in a corpus. Our model
    uses these seeds to improve both topicword distributions (by
    biasing topics to produce appropriate seed words) and to improve
    document-topic distributions (by biasing documents to select
    topics related to the seed words they contain). Extrinsic
    evaluation on a document clustering task reveals a signiﬁcant
    improvement when using seed information, even over other models
    that use seed information navely.
