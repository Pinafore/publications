  abstract	= {{We consider learning in a Markov decision process where
		  we are not explicitly given a reward function, but where
		  instead we can observe an expert demonstrating the task
		  that we want to learn to perform. This setting is useful in
		  applications (such as the task of driving) where it may be
		  difficult to write down an explicit reward function
		  specifying exactly how different desiderata should be
		  traded off. We think of the expert as trying to maximize a
		  reward function that is expressible as a linear combination
		  of known features, and give an algorithm for learning the
		  task demonstrated by the expert. Our algorithm is based on
		  using "inverse reinforcement learning" to try to recover
		  the unknown reward function. We show that our algorithm
		  terminates in a small number of iterations, and that even
		  though we may never recover the expert's reward function,
		  the policy output by the algorithm will attain performance
		  close to that of the expert, where here performance is
		  measured with respect to the expert's unknown reward
		  function.}},

Results suggest that the closest shadowers processed the material at the level of individual syllables. This is at variance, however, with the recent psycholinguistic emphasis on the importance in speech perception of syntactic and semantic structures. If such structures are not being used by the close shadower, information usually available from them will not be available. A memory test was therefore devised, and 13 of the Ss shadowed a 600-word passage, read at the same rate as before, and were immediately asked questions about content. Results show very little relation between latency and memory. Analysis of the errors made in recall also indicate that close and distant shadowers used syntactical and semantic information in the same way. All Ss appeared to analyze the material up to a semantic level as they repeated it. The perceptual decisions underlying their performance are determined in part by this analysis.

@article{jurafsky-96,
    Abstract = {{The problems of access--retrieving linguistic structure from some mental grammar --and disambiguation--choosing among these structures to correctly parse ambiguous linguistic input--are fundamental to language understanding. The literature abounds with psychological results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic rule access, parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation, and the processing of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to combine models which account for these results to build a general, uniform model of access and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic levels. For example, psycholinguistic theories of lexical access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic rule access have almost no commonality in methodology or coverage of psycholinguistic data. This article presents a single probabilistic algorithm which models both the access and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge. The algorithm is based on a parallel parser which ranks constructions for access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their conditional probability. Low-ranked constructions and interpretations are pruned through beam-search; this pruning accounts, among other things, for the garden-path effect. I show that this motivated probabilistic treatment accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results, arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic knowledge and for the use of probabilistically-enriched grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of and processing of language.}},

    abstract = {{A method is presented for calculating the amount of information conveyed to a hearer by a speaker emitting a sentence generated by a probabilistic grammar known to both parties. The method applies the work of Grenander (1967) to the intermediate states of a top-down parser. This allows the uncertainty about structural ambiguity to be calculated at each point in a sentence. Subtracting these values at successive points gives the information conveyed by a word in a sentence. Word-by-word information conveyed is calculated for several small probabilistic grammars, and it is suggested that the number of bits conveyed per word is a determinant of reading times and other measures of cognitive load.}},
