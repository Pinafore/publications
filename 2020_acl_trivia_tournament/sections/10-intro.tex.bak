This paper takes an unconventional analysis to answer ``where we've
been and where we're going'' in question answering (\abr{qa}).
Instead of approaching the question only as computer scientists, we
apply the best practices of trivia tournaments to \abr{qa} datasets.

The \qa{} community is obsessed with evaluation.
Schools, companies, and newspapers hail new \abr{sota}s and topping
leaderboards, giving rise to troubling claims~\cite{lipton-19} that an
``\abr{ai} model tops humans''~\citep{najberg-18} because it `won'
some leaderboard, putting ``millions of jobs at
risk''~\cite{cuthbertson-18}.
But what is a leaderboard? 
A leaderboard is a statistic about \qa{} accuracy that induces a ranking over participants.

Newsflash: this is the same as a trivia tournament. The trivia community has been doing this for decades~\cite{jennings-06}; 
Section~\ref{sec:tournament} details this
overlap between the qualities of a first-class \abr{qa} dataset (and
its requisite leaderboard).
The experts running these tournaments are imperfect, but they've learned from their past mistakes (see Appendix~\ref{sec:history} for a brief historical perspective) and created a community that reliably identifies those best at question answering.
Beyond the format of the \emph{competition}, trivia norms ensure individual questions are clear, unambiguous,
and reward knowledge (Section~\ref{sec:craft}).

We are not saying that academic \abr{qa} should surrender to trivia questions or the community---far from it!
The trivia community does not understand the real world information seeking needs of users or what questions challenge computers.
However, they have well-tested protocols to declare that someone is better at answering questions than another.
This collection of tradecraft and principles can nonetheless help the \abr{qa} community.

Beyond these general concepts that \abr{qa} can learn from, 
Section~\ref{sec:qb} reviews how the ``gold standard'' of trivia formats, Quizbowl, can improve traditional \abr{qa}.
We then briefly discuss how research that uses fun, fair, and good
trivia questions can benefit from the expertise, pedantry, and passion
of the trivia community (Section~\ref{sec:call}).
