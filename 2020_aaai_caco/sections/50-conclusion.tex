\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We investigate character-level knowledge transfer between related languages for
\abr{cldc}.
Our transfer learning scheme, \name{}, exploits character-level similarities
between related languages through shared character representations to
generalize from source language data.
Empirical evaluation on multiple related language pairs confirm that
character-level knowledge transfer is highly effective.
