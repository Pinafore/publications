\begin{abstract}
Previous work on question-answering systems has mainly focused on
answering individual questions, assuming they are independent and
devoid of context. Instead, we investigate sequential question
answering, in which multiple related questions are asked sequentially.
We introduce a new dataset of fully human-authored questions. We
extend existing strong question answering frameworks to include
information about previous asked questions to improve the overall
question-answering accuracy in open-domain question answering. 
The dataset is publicly available at \url{http://sequential.qanta.org}.
