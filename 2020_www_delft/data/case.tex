      1(+)&\textbf{Q}: This general was the leader of the nationalist side in the 
      \question{civil war} and ruled until his death in 1975. 
      He kept \question{Spain} neutral in the \question{Second World War} and is still dead.


      \textbf{A}: Francisco Franco  \hphantom{\dots\dots} \textbf{P}: \candidate{Francisco Franco}
      
      & The question directly maps to evidence sentence ``After the nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War, until his (\candidate{Francisco Franco}) death in 1975''.\\ 

      2(+)&\textbf{Q}: This \question{New England Patriots} quarterback was named \question{Super Bowl MVP}. He had three touchdown passes during the game: one each to \question{Deion Branch}, \question{David Givens}, and \question{Mike Vrabel}.

      \textbf{A}: Tom Brady \hphantom{\dots\dots} \textbf{P}: \candidate{Tom Brady}

      & Substantial evidence points to \candidate{Tom Brady} (correct): ``\candidate{Tom Brady}  plays for \question{New England Patriots}'', and ``\candidate{Tom Brady} had touchdown passes with \question{Deion Branch}''.
      \name{} aggregates evidence and makes the correct prediction. Without the graph structure, \memnn{} instead 
      predicts \candidate{Stephon Gilmore} (Another \question{New England Patriot}{}).\\
      
      3(-)&\textbf{Q}: Name this \question{European} nation which was divided into Eastern and Western regions after \question{World War II}. 

      \textbf{A}: Germany  \hphantom{\dots\dots}  \textbf{P}: \candidate{Yumen Pass}

      & No informative question entities that would lead to the key evidence sentence ``Germany divides into East Germany and West Germany''.\\ 

      4(-)&\textbf{Q}: \question{Telemachus} is the son of this hero, who makes a really long journey back home after the \question{Trojan War} in an epic poem by \question{Homer}.


      \textbf{A}: Odysseus  \hphantom{\dots\dots}  \textbf{P}: \candidate{Penelope}

      & \name{} can't make right prediction since the wrong candidate \candidate{Penelope} (Odysseus's wife) shares 
      most of the extracted evidence sentences with the correct answer (e.g., their son \question{Telemachus}).
