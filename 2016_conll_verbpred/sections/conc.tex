Verb prediction is hard for both machines and humans but impossible
for neither.  Verbs become more predictable in discriminative settings
as more of the sentence is revealed, and when all of the prior context
is available, the verbs are highly predictable by humans when a
limited number of choices is available, though even then not perfectly
so.  While we make no claims concerning upper or lower bounds of
predictability in different settings, our dataset provides benchmarks
for future verb prediction research on publicly available corpora:
cognitive scientists can validate prediction, confusion, and
anticipation; engineers have a human benchmark for their systems; and
linguists can conduct future experiments on predictability.




Shallow features can be used to predict verbs more accurately with
more context. Improving verb prediction can benefit simultaneous
translations systems that have already shown to benefit from verb
predictions, as well as enable new applications that involve
predicting future linguistic input.
