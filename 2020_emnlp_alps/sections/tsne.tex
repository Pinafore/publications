    \caption{\abr{t-sne} plots of \bert~embeddings
        and surprisal embeddings for each sequence in the \abr{imdb} training
        dataset.  The enlarged points are the centers determined by \km{} (left)
        and \kmpp{} (right). The points are colored according to their classification labels.
In both sets of embeddings, we cannot clearly separate the points from their
labels, but the distinction between clusters in surprisal embeddings seems more obvious.
