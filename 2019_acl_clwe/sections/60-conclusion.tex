\section{Conclusion}

We identify two conditions that make cross-lingual orthogonal mapping easier:
length-invariance and center-invariance, and provide a simple algorithm that
transforms monolingual embeddings to satisfy both conditions.  Our method
improves word translation accuracy of different mapping-based \abr{clwe}
algorithms across languages.
In the future, we will investigate whether our method helps other downstream
tasks.
