%This paper focuses on two primary research %questions: 

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item RQ1: How does varying explanation and support for feedback affect user experience; in particular, how does it affect frustration, trust, and acceptance?
%    \item RQ2: Do users that do not provide feedback, still expect the model to improve (expectation of improvement)? And is this affected by whether they receive an explanation?
%\end{itemize}
