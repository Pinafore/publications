    \caption{Results of single-sample $t$-tests between \name{} and
    \textbf{Base}, \name{} and \textbf{Active}, and \textbf{A+C} and
    \textbf{Active}, showing the $p$-value, the $t$ statistic, and the
    degree of freedoms $df$.
    \name{} is significantly better
    than \textbf{Base}, and \textbf{A+C} is significantly
    better than \textbf{Active} across different languages and embedding models.
    The only combination with results that are not significantly
    different is \name{} and \textbf{Active} for Sinhalese
    (\abr{cca}).

    \label{tab:t}
\end{table}

We run single-sample $t$-tests with $.05$ significance level to see whether
adding word-level annotations with $\name{}$ can significally improve
classification accuracy.
We compare \name{} against \textbf{Base}, \name{} against \textbf{Active}, and
\textbf{A+C} against \textbf{Active}.  We use the user study results from the
Sinhalese models (both \abr{cca} and \abr{rcsls}) and the Ilocano model.
Table~\ref{tab:t} shows that
\name{} is not
significantly different from \textbf{Active} for the Sinhalese \abr{cca}
embeddings but does significantly improve accuracy for the Ilocano model.
Overall, \name{} is significantly
different from \textbf{Base} and \textbf{A+C} is significiantly different from
\textbf{Active} across the experiments for all models.
