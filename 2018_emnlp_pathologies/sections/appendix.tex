\section{Model and Training Details}
\label{sec:model_supplemental}

\paragraph{\squad{}: Reading Comprehension}
The model we use for \squad{} is the Document Reader of
\abr{DrQA}~\cite{chen2017drqa}. We use the open source
implementation from \url{https://github.com/hitvoice/DrQA}. The model
represents the words of the paragraph as the concatenation of: 
\abr{GloVe} embeddings~\cite{pennington2014glove}, other word-level
features, and attention scores between the words in the paragraph and
the question. The model runs a \abr{BiLSTM} over the sequence and
takes the resulting hidden states at each time step as a word's final
vector representation. Two classifiers then predict the beginning and
end of the answer span independently. The span with the highest
product of beginning and end probabilities is selected as the answer.
In input reduction, we keep the exact same span.

\paragraph{\snli{}: Textual Entailment}
The model we use for \snli{} is the Bilateral Multi-Perspective
Matching Model (\abr{BiMPM})~\cite{wang2017bilateral}.
We use the open source implementation from
\url{https://github.com/galsang/BIMPM-pytorch}. The model runs a
\abr{BiLSTM} over the \abr{GloVe} word embeddings of both
the premise and hypothesis. It then computes ``matches'' between the two
sentences at multiple perspectives, aggregates the results using
another \abr{BiLSTM}, and feeds the resulting representation
through fully-connected layers for
classification.

\paragraph{\vqa{}: Visual Question Answering}
The model we use for \vqa{} is Show, Ask, Attend and
Answer~\cite{kazemi2017show}.  We use the open source implementation
from \url{https://github.com/Cyanogenoid/pytorch-vqa}.  The model uses
a ResNet-152~\cite{he2016resnet} to represent the image and an
\abr{LSTM} to represent the natural language question.  The model then
computes attention regions based on the two representations.  All
representations are finally combined to predict the answer.

\paragraph{Entropy Regularized Fine-Tuning}
To optimize the objective of Equation ~\ref{regularizer}, we alternate
updates on the two terms. We update the model on two
batches of regular examples for the first term (maximum likelihood), followed
by two batches of reduced examples for the second term (maximum entropy). The batches of
reduced examples are randomly sampled from the collection of reduced
inputs. We use two separate Adam~\cite{kingma2015adam} optimizers for
the two terms.  For \squad{} and \snli{}, we use a learning rate of
$2e^{-4}$ and $\lambda$ of $1e^{-3}$.  For \vqa{}, we use a learning
rate of $1e^{-4}$ and $\lambda$ of $1e^{-4}$.

\section{More Examples}
\label{sec:example_supplemental}

This section provides more examples of input reduction.  We show
the original and reduced examples, which are generated on the models both 
\emph{Before} and \emph{After} fine-tuning with the entropy regularization from
Section~\ref{sec:entropy_training}. All examples are correctly classified by the model.

Context & In 1899, John Jacob Astor IV invested \$ 100,000 for Tesla
    to further develop and produce a new lighting system. Instead,
    Tesla used the money to fund his \mybox{coloranswer}{Colorado
    Springs experiments}. \\

Context & The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the
    divisional round, 23–16, by scoring 11 points in the final three
    minutes of the game. They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX
    champion \mybox{coloranswer}{New England Patriots} in the AFC
    Championship Game, 20–18, by intercepting a pass on New England's
    2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock.
    Despite Manning's problems with interceptions during the season,
    he didn't throw any in their two playoff games. \\

Context & In 2014, economists with the Standard \& Poor's rating
    agency concluded that the widening disparity between the U.S.'s
    wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its
    recovery from the 2008-2009 recession and made it more prone to
    \mybox{coloranswer}{boom-and-bust cycles}. To partially remedy the
    wealth gap and the resulting slow growth, S\&P recommended
    increasing access to education. It estimated that if the average
    United States worker had completed just one more year of school,
    it would add an additional \$105 billion in growth to the
    country's economy over five years. \\

    recession of 2008 ? \\

Context & The Central Region, consisting of present-day Hebei,
    Shandong, Shanxi, the south-eastern part of present-day Inner
    Mongolia and the Henan areas to the north of the Yellow River, was
    considered the most important region of the dynasty and directly
    governed by the Central Secretariat (or Zhongshu Sheng) at
    \mybox{coloranswer}{Khanbaliq} (modern Beijing); similarly,
    another top-level administrative department called the Bureau of
    Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (or Xuanzheng Yuan) held
    administrative rule over the whole of modern-day Tibet and a part
    of Sichuan, Qinghai and Kashmir. \\

Context & It became clear that managing the Apollo program would
    exceed the capabilities of Robert R. Gilruth's Space Task Group,
    which had been directing the nation's manned space program from
    NASA's Langley Research Center. So Gilruth was given authority to
    grow his organization into a new NASA center, the Manned
    Spacecraft Center (MSC). A site was chosen in
    \mybox{coloranswer}{Houston, Texas}, on land donated by Rice
    University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on
    September 19, 1961. It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its
    practice of controlling missions from its Cape Canaveral Air Force
    Station launch facilities in Florida, so a new Mission Control
    Center would be included in the MSC. \\
