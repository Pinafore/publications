\section{Entity collapses of demographic \demorow{}s}
While mapping \qa{} examples to person entities and values for their corresponding demographic characteristics (Section \ref{sec:mapping}), we encountered many nearby values: `Poet', `Writer', `Author'. We collapse such values into a single label which we use for further analysis. This section enlists all the collapses that we encounter for determining nationality of people (Appendix~\ref{appendix:country-collapse}) and their professions (Appendix~\ref{appendix:professions-collapse}).
