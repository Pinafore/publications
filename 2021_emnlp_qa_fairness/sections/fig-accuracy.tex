  \caption{
  Accuracies split by demographic \demosubset{}s in our \abr{qa} datasets' dev fold for all three \democol{}s compared to average accuracy (vertical line). For each dataset, we only consider examples that have a mention of a person-entity in either the answer, question or document title.
    Individual plots correspond to a $\chi^2$ test on whether demographic \demorow{}s and accuracy are independent (Section~\ref{subsec:chi-squared-test}) with the significant \democol{}s highlighted in red ($p$-value < 0.0167).}
