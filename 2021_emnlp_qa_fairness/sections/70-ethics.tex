\section*{Ethical Considerations}
\label{sec:ethics}

This work analyses demographic subsets across \qa{} datasets based on Gender, Nationality and Profession. 
We believe the work makes a positive contribution to representation and diversity by pointing out the skewed distribution of existing \abr{qa} datasets.
To avoid noise being interpreted as signal given the lack of diversity in these datasets, we could not include various subgroups that we believe should have been part of this study: non-binary, intersectional groups (e.g., women scientists in \abr{nq}), people indigenous to subnational regions, etc. 
We believe increasing representation of all such groups in \abr{qa} datasets would improve upon the status quo.
We infer properties of mentions using Google Cloud-\abr{nl} to link the entity in a \abr{qa} example to an entry in the \textsc{WikiData} knowledge base to attribute gender, profession and nationality. 
We acknowledge that this is not foolproof and itself vulnerable to bias, although our small-scale accuracy evaluation did not reveal any concerning patterns.

All human annotations are provided by authors to verify entity-linkings and were fairly compensated.
