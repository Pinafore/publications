\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Tandem anchors extend the anchor words algorithm to allow multiple words to be
combined into anchor facets.
For interactive topic modeling, using anchor facets in place of single word
anchors produces higher quality topic models and are more intuitive to use.
Furthermore, our approach scales much better than existing interactive topic
modeling techniques, allowing interactivity on large datasets for which
interactivity was previous impossible.

In addition to a faster, interactive algorithm, anchor methods provide
a more direct path from user input to a final clustering output.By making interactivity both fast and intuitive, tandem anchors help
remove some of the mystery of machine learning algorithms, improving
trust in algorithms and eventual adoption.
